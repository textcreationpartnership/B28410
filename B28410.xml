            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why did you put her into private Lodgings?</p>
               <p>A. Because he was afraid, in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances that he is now, that some body might give them some Affront, or do them an Injury, and therefore he thought it best to be in some place of security.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> No, I beg your Lordships Pardon, I will recollect my memory, for that as I have a Soul to be sav'd, now it is come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my mind, my Master sent for <hi>Nicholas</hi> into <hi>Holland</hi> about a Year before <hi>Nicholas</hi> did come over; my Master told me before he came, that he would send for <hi>Nicholas</hi> again, and that I and <hi>Nicholas</hi> should have the Charge of his House. <hi>Nicholas</hi> came o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and we had the play at our own House, <hi>Nicholas</hi> staid there some time, but he did not like his business, and so he went away
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:204991:11"/> again, because he could not have all the Mony?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I carried no Cloaths to him when I wore his Livery.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To the best of my knowledge 'twas about five Years.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> I can't swear it was more, but I believe it may be five Year more or less.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> You say, you saw her two or three times there, was it all in one Year, near the same time or Month, can you reduce it to any certainty?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I believe it might be in Summer.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, I believe all in one, to the best of my knowledge, there was never a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter betwen the time that I saw her first and last.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you know the Dutchess of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> before that time that you saw her in your Master's House, and took her to be the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not know her before the Tryal was here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you know her any time after that Tryal, before the time you saw her in Sir <hi>John Germaine</hi>'s House?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was not sure that it was she, only as I had it from Mr. <hi>Keemer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Then you don't undertake of your own knowledge to say that it was she?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I can't swear that 'twas she, but as Mr. <hi>Keemer</hi> told me, I don't know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I should know her now or not, 'tis so long since I saw her, I believe it is five Years if not more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you see her before or after you saw her at Sir <hi>John Germaine</hi>'s House?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The first time they told me 'twas she, I met her in her Coach in the <hi>Pallmall,</hi> with two other Gentlewomen with her, a little before the Tryal was here, I follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Coach, and the Dutchess went into some Ladies House in <hi>Dover-Street,</hi> and they told me the Dutchess was the first Woman that went out, this is the first time that e're I saw her, that I know of, till such time as <hi>Keemer</hi> told me 'twas she.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Whether do you know <hi>Nicholas?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, he has been here two or three times in <hi>England,</hi> since I left my Master.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How long before this Examination, saw you him, or spoke with him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not see him above these three Years.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How long before you came hither as a Witness did you see him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I have not seen him these three Years till I came hither to be a Witness, and did admire to see him here, that a man that had got his bread under his Master should appear here against him, it is so ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it that you had so much curiosity as to follow the Dutchess's Coach?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I had a mind to satisfie my own Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
               <p>Q. D'ye know how <hi>Nicholas</hi> lived since he was out of his Master's Service?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, I never saw him, nor had any account of him at all, nor have seen him these three Years 'till now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know when <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianor Vaness</hi> went out of <hi>England?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, I neither knew when they went, nor when they came.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know what business he went out of <hi>England</hi> about, the time you took his Place?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I know not the business he went out of <hi>England</hi> upon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he at that time tell you he was to get away to hide himself from coming hither?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, I heard not one Word from him at the time of his parting.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you to say upon the first sight of <hi>Hauseur</hi> that he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful for coming hither?</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:204991:12"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I should think my self ungrateful to eat a Gentleman's Bread seven Years, and to do him all the Spite and Malice I could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Repeat those words?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I should think my self very ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to prosecute, if I should do any harm to a Master that I had served so many Years, I should think my self very ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, let him think of himself what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> He added some other words?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For any thing I know it is Spite and Malice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Where did you live, when you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Dutchess's Coach?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> At Mr. <hi>Germaine</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> This Man is a Witness, and so is <hi>Hosier,</hi> let him explain himself what he means; and wherein there is any Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between him and <hi>Hosier,</hi> for both are Witnesses?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I say, I should think my self very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, if I would do any harm to a man whose Bread I had eat so long, and had got so much mony under him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What harm does <hi>Hosier</hi> do, being a Witness against the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> what harm is that to Sir <hi>John Germaine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I don't know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> D'ye reckon it ungrateful to speak the truth to the prejudice of a Master?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, I would not speak an untruth for all the Masters in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Where is there any fault more in <hi>Hosier</hi> than in you?</p>

                  <hi>A</hi> I know not who she is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> This Woman that was here as a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I came to live with the Dutchess about <hi>October,</hi> 1691. and left her in <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> about two Years within two Months: <hi>Eleanor Vaness</hi> lived there when I lived there, and was Cook-Maid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> When did she leave the Dutchess's Service?</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> About the beginning of <hi>January,</hi> or the latter end of <hi>December,</hi> 1691.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> On what Occasion went she away?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> She was turned away, to the best of my remembrance, for keeping Company with <hi>Dutch-men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Whether used she any other Office but in the Kitchin? or had she access to the Dutchess's Chamber?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Never; she was not allowed to come any higher than the first Floor: She us'd to clean that Room next the Street, one pair of Stairs next the Door, and the back-Parlour even with that, but was not suffered to come into the Dutchess's Chamber.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Who waited upon the Dutchess in her Chamber?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. Frances Knight;</hi> she was constantly in the Dutchess's Chamber, and used to warm her Bed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> You say that <hi>Vaness</hi> was allowed to come no higher than the first Floor; Explain that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Kitchin is under-ground backward; that Room <hi>Vaness</hi> cleaned was even with the Street, a Ground-Room; the Landry-Maid clean'd the next pair of Stairs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What was the Landry-Maid's Name?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. Susan;</hi> she's dead.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Did you ever see <hi>Vaness</hi> in the Dutchess's Chamber?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Never in my life; I never heard she was allowed to come there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How long is it since you liv'd with the Dutchess?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> About six or seven Years, or very near it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> D'ye remember the Bill that was brought into Parliament against the Dutchess, while you lived there?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I came to the Dutchess the <hi>October</hi> before that Bill was brought in.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> Was <hi>Vaness</hi> turn'd away before that?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> She was gone a Month or thereabouts before that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> D'ye remember the Month?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To the best of my remembrance, 'twas about the latter end of <hi>December,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>January.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Was there any stir about the <hi>Dutch</hi> Foot-Soldiers haunting <hi>Vaness?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I never saw any, but have heard the Servants say they did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Can you say what time it was? Was it before or after the Bill?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Before I heard any thing of the Bill she was gone.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, I saw the Fellows, they came to the Door in the dusk of the Evening, and I acquainted the Dutchess with it, and told her Grace, I did not think it safe for her House, because I had the Charge of Silver Spoons and Forks.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> I never heard of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you ever see him come in at that Door? <hi>A.</hi> Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How? Upon what Occasion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I happen'd to be going out my self, and to open the Door for him. His Business, I was told by my Lady-Dutchess's Maid, was, That she had lent Money to a Man in <hi>Holland,</hi> and she wrote a Letter to be carry'd by this Man to her Sister, to get the Money; and she sent another Letter by one <hi>Bull,</hi> to carry to <hi>Holland,</hi> to get the Money, as she told me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q</hi> Did you let him in?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I unbolted the Door, and let him in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you find that this Man used to come freely to the House, at that Door, by any Key?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, I never knew it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who did he come to?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To <hi>Susan Barrington.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you ever see him above stairs with her?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; he might come in, and I not see it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did the Dutchess or Servants say any thing that he had Leave to come in?</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:204991:16"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I never examin'd that; because any body that had Business had leave to come in, as Tradesmen, and others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did they tell you in the House, that <hi>Hauseur</hi> was at liberty to come into the House with a Key? <hi>A.</hi> No, Never</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Had you ever any Discourse with <hi>Hauseur?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was one day coming from <hi>Change,</hi> and met Mr. <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> and this <hi>Hauseur. L'Estrange</hi> told me that he was ill of the Gripes. I told him, that the best thing for it was Burnt-Claret; and he and I and <hi>Hauseur</hi> went to a Tavern in <hi>Smithfield:</hi> And while we were together, <hi>Hauseur</hi> reflected upon his Master, saying, His Master had used him ill, and deserved to be ill used. Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> heard these and some more words; and Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> told me that he spoke to that purpose, he was resolv'd to be reveng'd of his Master.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did he say of his Master?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He said his Master had used him very ill; he had many threatning Words; he said his Master was an ill Man, and deserved to be ill used, and the time would come when he should repent it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When did he say these words?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Twas about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> two Years ago, or a Year ago, I can't tell which.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> How long?</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Occasion had he to come to the Dutchess's House?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I know not, but about the business of the Letter.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was his Business with her?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> About the Money, as she told me. He went along with that Woman; she sent a Letter by him; and she sent Letters by some other <hi>Dutchmen,</hi> into <hi>Holland,</hi> about the Money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did he ask for any other Servant? <hi>A.</hi> Not that I know of.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you see him above stairs with her?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I never saw them in any Apartment but that place below, where the Lumber is, near the <hi>Park</hi>-Door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> D'you know <hi>Susan Barrington? A.</hi> I know her very well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> D'you know where she is now?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Her Mother dy'd about the 10th. of <hi>January,</hi> and then I saw her all in Tears, and she went away after this Account of her Mother's Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When did you see her last?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I have not seen her this Fortnight or Month, that I know of, that I could distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish her from another Woman, except she had a Mask on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How long before this Tryal saw you her?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> About a Fortnight. She gave me an Account that her Mother died the 10th. of <hi>January,</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When did she go away?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not take notice of the Time she went away?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you know <hi>Hauseur</hi> at any other Place but at the Lady-Dutchess's?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Never, but as I have seen him in the <hi>Park,</hi> and with Mr. <hi>L'Estrange.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was you never with him at Sir <hi>John Germaine</hi>'s. <hi>A.</hi> Never.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> D'you know Sir <hi>John Germaine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> After I had lived with the Dutchess some time, I was told by some in the street, that that was his Coach, and his Livery, and that he was the Man that there was so much Noise about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you never see him in the Dutchess's House?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I never saw him in no part of my Lady-Dutchess's House, nor in no Apartment, and I am the only Man that goes up and down Stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you never see him in the Dutchess's Company at any other Place? <hi>A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you constantly lie at the Dutchess's House?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> When the Dutchess was last at <hi>Drayton,</hi> I lay at <hi>Richmond</hi> two or three Nights.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:204991:17"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you lie constantly there, when the Dutchess was there?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I was sick near a Month, and all that time I lay at my Wife's; but most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly lay at the Dutchess's since she is come to <hi>Duke-street</hi> to live.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> You say you used to open the Door in the <hi>Park</hi> first in a Morning; What time did you use to open it at?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> At Six, Seven, or Eight a Clock in a Morning; there was no certain hour, but I generally open'd that Door.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you ever know <hi>Hauseur</hi> come in at any other Door but that?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; one wet Day he came in at the Street-Door, before the Porter, and all the Servants, and ask'd for the same Woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did he never ask for any other Body?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I never heard him ask for any but <hi>Susan Barrington,</hi> for she was his Country-woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If <hi>Nicholas</hi> got in at the <hi>Park-Door,</hi> Could not he get up Stairs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If he could get in at that Door he talks of, he could not get into the Dutchess's Apartment; for there was a Room betwixt that, where the Plate and Jewels lay, that no Key could open: that if he could get up two Pair of Stairs, he could not get in there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If he had a Key, and got in at any Door; Cou'dn't <hi>Susan Barrington,</hi> when he came in, without any difficulty, lead him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I can't say but she might, but I never saw him, but below stairs with that Woman, and then he went away without going up stair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you never see him bring any thing to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> You nam'd one <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> that you saw with him at the Tavern; What is he?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was my old Fellow-Servant at the late Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Discourse had you with him then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He complain'd to me of his being ill, and I gave him the best of my Advice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What time was it that <hi>Nicholas</hi> had those threatning Words against his Master?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> About Ten, Eleven or Twelve a Clock at Noon.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I can't tell if it be a year, or two year; 'twas a little after <hi>Michaelmas;</hi> but whether it be one year or two year, I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Cou'dn't Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> tell?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I ask'd Mr. <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> and he cou'd not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose Servant was <hi>Nicholas</hi> then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was no body's Servant then. He rail'd against his Master at that time for turning him away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know who was his Master a year or two ago?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He told me he was out of Place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not know him to be Sir <hi>John Germaine</hi>'s Servant, when he came to the Dutchess's?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not know it, when I first saw him and <hi>Susan</hi> together; but some time before he went away, I heard he was his Servant.</p>
               <p>Q. But you say, you did not know Sir <hi>John Germaine</hi> about two years ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I did not know him, so as to speak to him.</p>

               <p>

               <p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> I saw her on <hi>Tuesday</hi> Seven-night last, in the Morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How came you to know she was gone, if you don't know the Time when she went?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I was told by the Dutchess, that <hi>L'Estrange</hi> had been with her, and gave her an Account of some Particulars between <hi>White,</hi> and him, and <hi>Nicholas;</hi> That having the Griping in the Guts, they went into a Tavern together; That he heard <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> talk together very loud, but he told me he had the Gripes, and could not so well mind what he said, but he heard him use hard words against his Master, but he could not remember that he said he would be Reveng'd upon his Master; but he would recollect himself, and if he could remember, he would say what he could. He told me, he had been bred in the <hi>Norfolk</hi> Family.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you ask Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> about this Matter?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes, Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> told me, he remembred they were together, and heard <hi>Nicholas</hi> speak very hard, ill words against his Master, but he could not be positive what they were; but what he could remember, he would speak, if that would do the Dutchess any service. He desired my Lady-Dutchess would give him Notice the Night before, and he would appear.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; that gave me the Occasion to speak of it. He said, he heard <hi>Nicholas</hi> say
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:204991:18"/> hard, ill Words against his Master, but not that he heard him say he would study to be reveng'd. Perhaps, says he, there might be some other words. That he was in the Kitchin, and would endeavour to recollect who was there besides; and if he had two or three Days time, he would enquire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you let him know that you was concern'd for the Dutchess?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; and he told me he would tell what he could say in this Matter; and he should be ready to appear at any time, if that would be for the Dutchess's advantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did he tell you he was going abroad, into <hi>Holland? A.</hi> Not one word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you intimate to him, when the Dutchess was to make her Defence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I think I did, but I can't be positive; but he took no notice to me, that he would not be there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> D'you know Mr. <hi>La Fountaine? A.</hi> Yes, I know one <hi>La Fountaine.</hi>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is he in the Dutchess's Service? <hi>A.</hi> I believe not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> D'you know whether he is at <hi>Drayton? A.</hi> I have seen him at <hi>Drayton.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How long ago is that? <hi>A.</hi> About eight or nine Years ago, last <hi>Christmas.</hi> I would not have your Lordships think my Husband was so bad a Man; he was only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd and Executed for Changing Ten Pounds of his own Money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> What were your Husband's Last Dying Words? <hi>A.</hi> He desir'd me to send for this Fellow, and deliver those Things he left at my House. I sent for him. He came, and had some Keys in a Drawer, that my Husband told me he left there He took two or three Keys, and put them in his Pocket, and look'd mightily out of Countenance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did your Husband say to you? <hi>A.</hi> He bid me give <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Keys, and bid him have a care, and keep good Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> When was that? <hi>A.</hi> A Week or Fortnight before my Husband was Executed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you acquaint <hi>Nicholas</hi> with what your Husband said of him?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> No, an't please your Honours; I only told him, my Husband charg'd me to give him those Keys: but being in trouble, and having a great many Enemies, I talk'd no further with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What did <hi>Nicholas</hi> say to you? <hi>A.</hi> He look'd out of Countenance, and told me he would come and see me another time, but he never did: so that I did not see him again till I saw him in the <hi>Meuse,</hi> and then he told me that he would come to see me; but he never did, but always shun'd me.</p>

I did not understand her. I left a Note for her to Attend this Day.</p>
               <p>Then the Dutchess's Councel pray'd, that some Agreements between the Duke and Dutchess, in 1694, may be read out of the Deeds executed for that purpose. Which was agreed to, and read accordingly.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> I Desire Mr. <hi>Negus</hi> may be ask'd, Whether the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk</hi> did not send some Message by him? The Words I don't confine him to; but, Whether the Message sent by him to my Lord-Duke, was not to this purpose, That notwithstanding the Articles, she desir'd to know from his Grace, in what manner she should live, and that she would be govern'd by his Directions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I think it was much about the time of the Transaction of these Articles the Dutchess sent to me. Mr. <hi>Longueville</hi> was Councel for the Duke, and Sir <hi>Thomas Powys</hi> for the Dutchess. Mr. <hi>Longueville</hi> took what care he could; and when they came to talk of their living separately, I took it only to be an apprehension and fear that my Lord-Duke would confine the Dutchess to some House. My Lady-Dutchess sent for me. I waited on her, and she express'd her self very sensibly of the Misfortunes of the Duke and her self, that such Differences should have been between them; and she was desirous to let my Lord-Duke know, and desired me that I would let my Lord-Duke know it, that she would avoid all Company that should give him any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and that she would not so much as pay a Visit but where he liked. I acquainted my Lord-Duke with something to this purpose; for she often said to me, more than once or twice, that if she happen'd to die before my Lord-Duke, she would leave him her Estate: And I know I have said so to my Lord-Duke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Whether, from that time, do you know that the Duke sent any Message of Complaint to the Dutchess, to the Place where she liv'd, that he would have her live in any other way?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I know nothing of that Matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Do you know whether my Lord-Duke ever desired her to come and live with him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I never heard of any such thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did he ever send to her, to avoid any Company? <hi>A.</hi> I never heard of any such thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Whether had you any Directions to attend the Duke, That he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ive way in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy between the Dutchess and a Noble Lord of this House, whether he would wave his Privilege? <hi>A.</hi> I have great reason to desire Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Favour in this Matter. I know not what he aims at. I was call'd to the Barr before, to speak the Truth as to the Matter of the Privilege: I know not what he means by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> I meant it only as an Instance of a Civil Message between the Duke and Dutchess, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her as his Wife, and that this was a Message that bespoke a good understanding between them? <hi>A.</hi> Will you have me to give an Answer to Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> my Lords? I confess the Duke did send for me, and ask'd how the Settlement and Agreement were betwixt the Duke and the Dutchess, because of this Matter of the Privilege.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> I did not mean that; but only as a late Instance of the Duke's owning the Dutchess so far?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> When the Duke sent for me, he would know, whether by the Agreement he was oblig'd to let her have the Privilege? I said, I understood it so; and tho' he had no mind to do it, but as he had waved his Privilege, in the Case of an Unkle, he would do it for her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What would have been the Consequence, if the Duke had not waved his Privilege? Would not that have defended her from a Suit? <hi>A.</hi> That you may make use of as you please.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Powis.</hi> I would only make this use of it, as an Instance of Kindness between the Duke and Dutchess.</p>

            <head>THE Duke of <hi>NORFOLK</hi>'s Case: WITH REASONS for passing his BILL.</head>
            <p>IF want either of Precedent for a <hi>Parliamentary Divorce,</hi> before going through the tedious and ineffectual Methods of <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> or of Demonstration of Fact, have hitherto deprived the <hi>Duke of Norfolk</hi> of that Relief against his Wife's Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, which the <hi>Divine Law</hi> allows; The late Statute made in the like Case, and the Coming in of Two, who while the <hi>Duke</hi>'s former Bill was depending, had been sent away to prevent that Discovery which they now make; cannot but he thought to remove all Objections against an Act of Parliament, not only for the benefit of the <hi>Duke,</hi> but of <hi>the Publick:</hi> as a means to preserve the Inheritance of so great an <hi>Office,</hi> and <hi>Honours,</hi> to persons of the true Religion.</p>
            <p>And since <hi>Bishop Cozens</hi> his Argument in the <hi>Lord</hi> Rosse's <hi>Case</hi> has made it Evident, That those <hi>Canons</hi> which govern the <hi>Spiritual Court</hi> in this matter, are but the remains of <hi>Popery;</hi> nothing can be now requisite to satisfy the most scrupulous of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> but to set the <hi>Duke</hi>'s Proof of his <hi>Lady</hi>'s Adultery in a true light.</p>
            <p>The Reputation which the <hi>Dutchess</hi> had maintained, of Wit and Discretion, made it difficult for many to believe, that she could be surprized in the very Act of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, as had been formerly proved. And though then it appeared, That one <hi>Henry Keemer</hi> lived with the <hi>Dutchess,</hi> while she went by a feigned Name at an House hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for her at <hi>Foxhall,</hi> by Sir <hi>John Germain</hi>'s Brother; and that <hi>Nicola,</hi> who then lived with Sir <hi>John,</hi> used to receive Wood sent from the <hi>Dutchess</hi> to Sir <hi>John</hi>'s House by the <hi>Cockpit;</hi> the withdrawing of <hi>Nicola,</hi> and carrying with him the <hi>Dutch</hi> Maid, equally entrusted with the secret on Sir <hi>John</hi>s side; left no evidence of their constant conversation, but <hi>Keemer</hi> since dead, and <hi>Susannah Barrington,</hi> who had the like trust from the <hi>Dutchess.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Keemer,</hi> though very unwillingly, some years since confessed his living with the <hi>Dutchess</hi> at <hi>Foxhall,</hi> where he pretended she was obliged to conceal herself for Debt: and what share <hi>Susannah</hi> had in the secret was unknown, till <hi>Nicola</hi> appeared: <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola</hi> coming into <hi>England</hi> some time since, in expectation of a Service, express'd his readiness to discover what he knew, and to endeavour to bring with him the <hi>Dutch</hi> Maid.</p>

                  <hi>Eleanor Vanness.</hi> Exam. 22. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1699.</note>She proves, that for two Months the first Summer after the <hi>King</hi> came for <hi>England,</hi> Sir <hi>John Germain</hi> and the <hi>Dutchess</hi> lived together <hi>as Man and Wife,</hi> and were seen in Bed together by her, Mr <hi>Bryan,</hi> and his Wife, Sir <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Sister:</hi> and that <hi>Nicholas Hauseur,</hi> Sir <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> used to be assisting to him; as the <hi>Dutchess</hi>'s <hi>Woman, Susannah Barrington,</hi> was to her, at going to Bed, and rising.</p>
            <p>She proves the like Conversation at <hi>Foxhall,</hi> and the <hi>Dutchess</hi>'s <hi>House</hi> at the <hi>Millbank,</hi> till the <hi>Duke</hi>'s first Bill for a Divorce was depending; within which time <hi>Nicholas Hauseur,</hi> by Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Order, carried away her, and <hi>Susannah Barrington,</hi> with intention of going for <hi>Holland,</hi> to prevent their being examined to what they knew; but the Wind proving contrary, they could not go till the Bill was rejected, and then Sir <hi>John</hi> fetch'd back <hi>Susannah,</hi> who was most useful to the <hi>Dutchess;</hi> but <hi>Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seur</hi> went for <hi>Holland</hi> with <hi>Ellen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He confirms <hi>Ellen</hi>'s Evidence in every particular; and besides the Persons mentioned by <hi>Ellen,</hi> as privy to Sir <hi>John</hi>'s lying with the Dutchess, names Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Brother <hi>Daniel. Nicholas</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nicholas Hauseur.</note> having beeen found very trusty, his Master sent for him to return to his Service; and gave him the opportunity of proving the continuance of the same Adulterous Conversation at several Times and Places, from the Summer 1692. to the 26th of <hi>April</hi> 1696. He swears he had after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Service, seen them in Bed together at Sir <hi>John</hi>'s House,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:204991:21"/> at the <hi>Cockpit,</hi> and at the <hi>Dutchess</hi>'s Houses at <hi>Millbank,</hi> and where she now lives; and used to be let into the Dutchess's Apartment by <hi>Susannah Barrington,</hi> or <hi>Keemer.</hi> Nor can any man, who shall read the ample Testimonials given Mr <hi>Hauseur</hi> by Sir <hi>John;</hi> by the last of which it appears that he served him faithfully as his <hi>Steward,</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably question <hi>Hauseur</hi>'s Credit.</p>
            <p>Another who had been advanced by Sir <hi>John</hi> from his Footman to Mr <hi>Hauseur</hi>'s place, and from thence to a good Office in the Excise,<note place="margin">William Bayly.</note> very unwillingly confirmed the Testimony of <hi>Hauseur</hi> and the <hi>Dutch Maid,</hi> not only as to the time of their going from the Service of Sir <hi>John</hi> and the <hi>Dutchess;</hi> but though being no Foreigner he could not so easily be sent away to prevent discovery, and therefore was not let so far into the Secret as <hi>Hauseur</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Maid; yet he swears the <hi>Dutchess</hi> used to come mask'd to his <hi>Masters</hi> House; that he has gone with him as far as the <hi>Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferry</hi> towards her House at the <hi>Millbank;</hi> that then his Master sometimes <hi>lay out all Night,</hi> and the next morning he has <hi>carried Linnen and Cloathes</hi> for his <hi>Master</hi> to <hi>Keemer</hi>'s House, or <hi>Keemer</hi> has fetched them from him: And this he proves to have been since the rejecting the former Bill, and about Five Years since, when he was succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Hauseur,</hi> as before he had succeeded <hi>Hauseur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two other Foreigners, <hi>La Fountain,</hi> who had lived with Sir <hi>John,</hi> and was Served with Summons at the <hi>Dutchess</hi>'s House at <hi>Drayton;</hi> and <hi>Hugonee,</hi> who ran away from the Lord <hi>Haversham</hi>'s since Summons was taken out against him, seem to have had the same Trust that <hi>Hauseur</hi> had: for both declared, That nothing should oblige them to <hi>betray their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>'s <hi>Secrets:</hi> One said, <hi>No Court could dispense with his Oath of Secrecy:</hi> and both declared they would immediately go beyond Sea. Summons have been taken our for Mr <hi>Brian</hi> and his Wife, and Sir <hi>John Germain</hi>'s Brother (who are, or lately were in Town) to confess or deny what <hi>Nichola</hi> and <hi>Ellen</hi> appeal to them for; and it cannot be imagined that Sir <hi>John</hi> should chuse the Honour of being thought to have to do with a <hi>Dutchess,</hi> before the clearing her and himself from the Imputation, by bringing his Relations to disprove the charge, if what is sworn to be within their knowledge is false.</p>
            <p>And if Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Vanity should prevail with him, at least it is to be presumed that his Relations would be more just to him and the Lady, than to suffer any thing to pass against them, which they could with Truth and Justice prevent.</p>
            <p>But since none of them appear, the World will belie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e their absenting more than a thousand Witnesses, in confirmation of what Mr <hi>Hauseur, Ellen</hi> and <hi>Baily,</hi> have sworn. Whose Evidence not only stands untouch'd by any thing offered by the <hi>Dutchess</hi>'s Witnesses, but is plainly confirm'd by them in the principal parts.</p>
            <p>This being the nature of the proofs, 'tis observable,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there never yet was any Case of this kind, where the Evidence was not liable to greater objections than can be made to this.</p>
            <p>Though in the latest Case of this kind, there was full Conviction of the Ladies having Children while she lived separate from her Husband, and the presumption was very violent whose the Children were; yet this was but presumption, and that was weakned by the presumption in Law that they were the Husbands; especially. since there was no direct proof of the Lovers ever lying with her.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tho in that case, by reason of the interval of Parliament, and fear of the deaths of Witnesses, a Suit was begun in <hi>Doctors Commons,</hi> 'twas taken from thence while the Suit was depending; therefore that was rather an Objection against proceeding in Parliament than an Argument for it.</p>

            <head>Bishop <hi>COZENS</hi>'s Argument, Proving, That <hi>Adultery works a Dissolution of the Marriage.</hi> Being the Substance of several of Bishop <hi>Cozens</hi> his Speeches in the House of Lords, upon the Debate of the Lord <hi>Ross</hi>'s Case. <hi>Taken from Original Papers writ in the Bishop's own Hand.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe Question is indefinitely to be spoken of, <hi>Whether a Man being divorced from his Wife, who hath committed Adultery, and is convicted of it, may Marry himself to another Wife or no, during the Life of her which is divorced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The place in St <hi>Matthew the</hi> 5th, repeated again St <hi>Matthew the</hi> 19th, has great perspicuity: If it be not lawful for any man to put away his Wife, and Marry again, except it be in the Case of Fornication, (for the displacing the Words, by putting the Exception before the Marriage, cannot alter the Sense); then <hi>à contrario,</hi> it must of necessity follow, That if the Wife be put away for Fornication, the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band by the tenor of Christ's Words is left free to Marry again; which Freedom is not allowed to the Adulteress herself, nor any man else that shall Marry her.</p>
            <p>St <hi>Mark</hi> and St <hi>Luke</hi> have been opposed to St <hi>Matthew;</hi> and it has been said, that <hi>Christs</hi> words in St <hi>Matthew</hi> did not properly belong to <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Disciples,</hi> or the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church,</hi> as the words in St <hi>Mark</hi> and St <hi>Luke,</hi> which are absolute, do; which is a Saying that neither I, nor, I think, no body else ever heard of before: For <hi>Christ</hi>'s Sermon in the Mount was spoken to <hi>his Disciples,</hi> and especially belonged to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis clear they are spoken to <hi>his Disciples;</hi> for he says to them, that they are <hi>the Salt of the Earth, and the Light of the World;</hi> and that they are <hi>blessed, when</hi> they <hi>suffer persecution for his Name's sake;</hi> which no man will say or apply to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, that in the 19th <hi>Chapter</hi> of St <hi>Matthew, Christ</hi> answers the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,</hi> who came to tempt him with their Question, <hi>Whether it was lawful for a man to put away his wife for any cause,</hi> as they said <hi>Moses had permitted them to do.</hi> But the Answer that <hi>Christ</hi> gave them, That ir was not lawful, <hi>but only in the case of Adultery, for men to put awny their wives, and marry another,</hi> was a Rule which concerned <hi>all Christians</hi> to observe for ever after; and for that reason was recorded by St <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words in St <hi>Mark</hi> and St <hi>Luke</hi> are not to be taken absolutely, but to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and understood by his words in St <hi>Matthew,</hi> as in many other cases is clear, <hi>viz.</hi> the Thief upon the Cross, Baptism in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereof many instances may be brought, as the destruction of <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for <hi>Christ</hi>'s words, the Exception confirms the Rule, and infers a Concession, that in the Case of <hi>Fornication,</hi> the putting away one Wife, and Marrying another is allowed. It is alike with divers other his Exceptions, which are found in Scip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For brevity, I will instance in this one <hi>(viz.) Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</hi> Upon which Text, if I or any Bishop else where to Preach, I believe we should not discharge our Duty, unless we should tell the People, That if by the Grace of <hi>God</hi> they did repent, they should not perish.</p>
            <p>The exception here, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>nisii,</hi> unless, is parallel with the 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.18. <hi>None were in the house, except we twain;</hi> they Two therefore were, others were not.</p>
            <p>Such Exceptions proceeding from natural Equity, are tacitly implied in Laws, tho pronounced in general terms.</p>
            <p>But as to the Exception here, the Words are not capable of any other Sense than as I have observed; for except that Restraint be referred to Marrying again, the Sense would run thus, <hi>Whosoever puts away his Wife commits Adultery;</hi> which stands not with Truth or Reason; since it is not the Dismission that is Adulterous, but the Marriage of another. It is, therefore, the plain drift of our Saviour to teach the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee,</hi> that the Marriage of a Second Wife after a dismission of a former, <hi>upon any other cause, except for fornication,</hi> is no less than Adultery; thereby inferring, That upon a Just Dismission for Fornication, a second Marriage cannot be branded with Adultery.</p>
            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:204991:23"/>
            <p>Besides, the <hi>Pharisee</hi>'s Question <hi>[Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause]</hi> was not without a plain implication of Liberty to matry another, which our <hi>Saviour</hi> well knowing, gives a full Answer, as well to what he meant, as what be said; which had not been perfectly satisfactory, if he had only determined that one part concerning Dismission, and not the other concerning Marriage, which Clause if Two <hi>Evangelists</hi> express not, yet it must be fetch'd necessa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Rhemists</hi> and Colledge of <hi>Doway</hi> urge for the <hi>Popish</hi> Doctrine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.2. <hi>The woman which hath an husband, is bound by the law to her husband as long as he liveth;</hi> but</p>
            <p n="1">1. This place is to be Expounded by <hi>Christs</hi> Words.</p>
            <p n="2">2. St <hi>Paul</hi> hath no occasion here to speak of <hi>Divorce,</hi> but of <hi>Marriage whole and sound,</hi> as it stands by <hi>Gods</hi> Ordinance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He speaks of a Woman who is under an Husband; so is not she that is divorced from him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. St <hi>Paul</hi> useth this to his purpose of the Law being dead, to which we are not bound.</p>
            <p>Nor is their Doctrine more favoured by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Let not the woman depart;</hi> as being in her Choice whether she would depart or not: but in the case of <hi>Fornication</hi> she was to depart, or rather be <hi>put away,</hi> whether she would or not.</p>
            <p>The Bond of Marriage is to be enquired into, what it properly is. Being a Conjugal Promise Solemnly made between a Man and his Wife, That each of them will live together according to <hi>God</hi>s Holy Ordinance, notwithstanding Poverty or Infirmity, or such other things as may happen during their Lives. Separation from Bed and Board, which is part of their promise so to live together, doth plainly break that part of the Bond whereby they are tied to live together both as to Bed and Board. The distinction betwixt Bed and Board and the Bond, is new, never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Scripture, and unknown in the Antient Church; devised only by the <hi>Canonists</hi> and the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> in the <hi>Latin Church</hi> (for the <hi>Greek Church</hi> knows it not) to serve the <hi>Pope</hi>'s turn the better, till he got it established in the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> at which time, and never before, he laid his <hi>Anathema</hi> upon all them that were of another Mind; forbidding all men to marry, and <hi>not to make any use of Christ's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bed and Board, or Cohabitation, belong to the Essence and Substance of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; which made <hi>Erasmus</hi> and Bishop <hi>Hall</hi> say, <hi>That the distinction of those two from the Bond, is meerly Chimerical</hi> and <hi>Fancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The promise of Constancy and mutual Forbearance, if it hinders Divorce as to the <hi>Bond,</hi> hinders it also as to bed and board; and because the same bed, and the same table were promised in the Marriage Contract; but the promise does not extend even to Tolerating <hi>Adultery,</hi> or <hi>Malicious Desertion;</hi> which, according to <hi>God's Ordinance, Dissolves the Marriage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Saviour</hi> speaks of Divorces Instituted by the <hi>Mosaical Law;</hi> but they were no other than Divorces from the <hi>Bond.</hi>

            <p>The Form of the <hi>Bill of Divorce,</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> was this, <hi>Be Expelled from me, and free for any body else.</hi> To give the bill of Divorce, is from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Root <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which is to break, or cut off the Marriage. With this agree the ancient <hi>Canons, Councils,</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concil. Neocaesar. &amp; Elib.</hi> forbid the retaining an Adulterous Wife. <hi>Concil. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.

            <p>
               <hi>Lactantius,</hi> St <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> are for allowance of Marriage after Divorce. <hi>Chrysostom, Hom.</hi> 19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. says, That <hi>the Marriage is dissolved by adultery; and that the husband, after he hath put her away, is no longer her husband.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theophylact</hi> on the 16th of St. <hi>Luke</hi> says, That St <hi>Luke</hi> must be interpreted by St <hi>Matthew.</hi> St <hi>Hillary</hi> is for marrying again, as Dr <hi>Fulk</hi> saith upon St <hi>Matthew</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:204991:23"/> the 7th. The <hi>Eastern</hi> Bishops, in the <hi>Council of Florence,</hi> are for marrying again. <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> speaks of a Christian Woman's giving a bill of Divorce to a dissolute Husband, without finding any fault with it.</p>
            <p>St <hi>Ambrose</hi> says, a man may marry again, if he put away an adulterous Wife; <hi>Theodoret</hi> said of a Wife who violated the Laws of Marriage; <hi>Therefore our Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the Bond or Tye of Marriage to be dissolved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the <hi>Greek Church</hi> to this day allow it. <hi>Erasmus, Cajetan,</hi> and other Papists: The Civil Law, and the Laws of the Emperor are clear for it: And the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our own Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>E.</hi> 6. and Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Practice of the <hi>English</hi> Church: In the Stat. 1 <hi>Jac. c.</hi> 11. against Second Marriages, Divorces are excepted; and in <hi>Canon</hi> 107. 'tis provided they shall not marry again; but it is not said such Marriages are void, only the Caution is forfeited: <hi>Neither doth the Canon speak of such Separations, wherein the Bond itself is broken, as 'tis by Fornication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even the <hi>Canon Law</hi> allows marrying again, in case a Woman seek her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's life, and in case of a Bond-woman. <hi>Gratian</hi> says, in the Cause of Adultery Lawful Marriages ought not to be denied. In the case of an incurable Leprosy, it was the Advice of St <hi>Gregory</hi> to <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk. That he that could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, should rather marry. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> owns, that the Bond of the Marriage of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels is dissolvable; but the Marriage of the Faithful and of Infidels is of the same nature: and <hi>Justinian,</hi> a Jesuit, confesses, that it is simply lawful for the innocent party to marry again. And the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors allow a dissolution of the Bond of Marriage, if the parties should, after consummation, transfer themselves into a Friery or Nunnery.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Canons</hi> which in the case of Adultery prohibit Marrying in the life time of the guilty person, are contrary to 2 Acts of Parliament made 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and 3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 4 <hi>E.</hi> 6,<note place="margin">Ref. Leg. Eccles. Tit. de Adulteriis &amp; Divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis.</note> wherein no <hi>Canons</hi> are allowed that be any way <hi>repugnant to the Laws of God, or the Scripture, the King's Prerogative Royal, and the Statutes of this Land,</hi> 32 persons were to review the <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> in which Review, drawn up by <hi>Archbishop Cranmer,</hi> the Innocent person is permitted to marry again, <hi>according to Christ's Law and Concession.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have examples of such Marriages in <hi>H.</hi> 4. of <hi>France, H.</hi> 8. of <hi>England,</hi> Lord <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> Lord <hi>Rich,</hi> Bishop <hi>Thornborough,</hi> and divers others. And it is observable, That in the Case of the <hi>Marquis of Northampton,</hi> 5 <hi>E.</hi> 6. who had been divorced for his Lady's Adultery, and married another before any Act of Parliament made concerning it, an Act which passed afterwards (only two Spiritual and two Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Lords dissenting) declares he had been <hi>at liberty by the Laws of God to marry,</hi> and did <hi>lawfully marry</hi> another; where the Act manifestly supposes, that whatever had obtained for Law till that time, was void, as being <hi>contrary to God's Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The most considerable Men of the Reform'd Churches both at home and abroad are of this opinion: <hi>Grotius</hi> quotes <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in whose time it was lawful for the innocent party to Marry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lancelot Inst. Jur. Can.</hi> acknowledges that Divorce is a dissolution of the Marriage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Selden,</hi> who is not likely to contradict the Laws of this Kingdom, maintaineth, That Marriage after Divorce is to be allowed; and in that particular, Dr <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> doth not contradict him, but is clearly for it.</p>
            <p>The Opinion of <hi>Amesius</hi> deserves to be set down at large: <q>Marriage, says he, cannot be dissolved by men at their pleasure; and for that reason, as it is considered simply and absolutely, it is rightly said to be indissolvable; because Marriage is not only a Civil, but a Divine Conjunction; and is also of that nature, that it cannot be dissolved without detriment to either Party: Yet it is not so indissolvable, but it may be dissolved for a Cause which God approves as just; for the Indissolvability was not instituted for a punishment, but for the Comfort of innocent persons; and it admits an exception, wherein God ceases to conjoyn. By Adultery two are made not to remain one Flesh: hence it is, that a Contagious disease is not a cause of dissolving Marriage. <hi>By Adultery the very Essence of the Contract is directly violated; but the Contract ceasing, the Bond depending on the Contract necessarily ceases.</hi> It is against all reason, that all Matrimonial Duties should be for ever taken away, yet the Bond or Obligation to those du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties should continue. The words of <hi>our Lord, Matth.</hi> 5.32. and 19.9. have no distinction or limitation of the putting away, but simply and absolutely approve of putting away; therefore they approve of putting away, not partial, or to a particular purpose, from Bed and Board, but <hi>Total.</hi>

               <hi>Dr Howson</hi> was a professed Adversary to <hi>Dr Raynolds,</hi> who was a great Maintainer of the Church of <hi>England</hi> against all the points of Popery, and particularly in this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dr. Taylor,</hi> Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> Dr <hi>Fulk,</hi> are for second Marriages; no Authors against them but the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> and those of the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> whose Credit is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saved by those of our Church who agree with them.</p>
            <p>Upon the difference of Explication between St <hi>Ambrose, Origen,</hi> and St <hi>Austin,</hi> a new kind of Divorce has been thought of, <hi>from Bed and Board;</hi> but this <hi>Divorce,</hi> or <hi>Name of a Divorce,</hi> was unknown to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Ancient Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I said so much before, at the first and second reading of this Bill, that I was in good hopes to have had no further occasion given me of answering any Objections against it now; but seeing divers new Arguments have been studied and framed against it since that time, I shall now endeavour to satisfy and clear them all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The First Argument against it is, That the separation from Bed and Board doth not dissolve the Bond of Marriage. To which I must Reply, as I did before, That this is a distinction without a difference; newly invented by the <hi>Canonists</hi> and <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and never heard of either in the <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New Testament,</hi> nor in the times of the Antient Fathers, who accounted the Separation from Bed and Board, to be the Dissolution of the Bond itself.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That first Institution of Marriage, that they may be <hi>one Flesh,</hi> is by Adultery dissolved, when the Adultress makes her self <hi>one Flesh with</hi> another Man; and <hi>thereby dissolves the first Bond of her Marriage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Objection, that if the Bond be dissolved, and afterwards, if the Man or Woman be reconciled, they must be Married over again, is no necessary Consequence, no more than 'tis in a Person baptized, who may break his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and renounce his Baptism; and yet upon true Repentance be received into Gods Favour by virtue of the first Covenant, without any new Baptism. Suppose a Witch, who they say makes a Compact with the Devil, to renounce her Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism; should afterwards, by the Grace of God, seriously and truly Repent herself of the wickedness; I do not believe that any body would take upon him to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize her again: and if a Priest should renounce his Orders, and turn <hi>Turk,</hi> and yet afterwards repent him, and return into the Church, he need not be re-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a second time. The case will be the same in Marriage.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I said heretofore, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors allowed this Dissolution of the Bond when the Man and Wife, even after the consummation of Marriage, wou'd transfer themselves into a Friery, or a Nunnery: but because it hath been since doubted, that no Authority can be shewed for this particular, I shall here shew it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <head>THE CASE of <hi>Mary,</hi> Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>UPon the Marriage of the <hi>Dutchess</hi> with the now <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> in the year 1677, her Father the late <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Peterborough,</hi> paid as part of her Portion 10000 <hi>l.</hi> and Settled on that Marriage Lands of near 1000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> the Remainder of which on Failure of Issue was limited to the now Duke and his Heirs for ever; and the Earl after his and his Lady's death secured to the Duke the Forfeiture of <hi>Drayton,</hi> worth 10000 <hi>l.</hi> more, and the Duke receiv'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by Agreement 1000 <hi>l. per annum</hi> for Twenty years out of the Earls Estate; besides very rich Jewels, Plate, and other things of great value, which the Dutchess brought with her into the Duke's Family: And great Debts having been contracted, for the support of the Duke's Honour and his Service, while he cohabited with the Dutchess, she hath since his Separation from her paid them out of her own Estate.</p>
            <p>That by the evil and malicious insinuations of the Dutchess's enemies, the Duke was prevailed on to carry her, then a Protestant, into <hi>France,</hi> and to put her into a Monastery (where she could not be admitted without changing her Religion) and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ft her there, on great assurances of sending for her home in a short time, and so parted with great expressions of kindness.</p>
            <p>That a considerable time after, by the Dukes consent, she returned into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and lived retiredly at <hi>Drayton</hi> in <hi>Northamptonshire;</hi> and at the time of the Revolution she again retir'd to <hi>France,</hi> where, she continued till she heard of her Fathers's Imprisonment in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and then came back to <hi>England,</hi> and lived privately till her Father obtained his Liberty, when she came home to him.</p>
            <p>That the 8th of <hi>January,</hi> 1691. the Duke was prevailed on by the instigation of her Enemies, to exhibit a Bill in the House of Peers, to the same effect with the Bill now depending, and divers Witnesses were examined on both sides, after which and a long solemn debate and due consideration had by their Lordships of the Witnesses, and what was Sworn by them, the 17th of <hi>February,</hi> they were pleased to reject the Bill without a second reading.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding which the Duke was again prevailed on the 22th of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1692. to exhibit a Second Bill in the House of Peers, to the same effect with his First, which after several debates, was the 2d of <hi>January</hi> following again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
            <p>Sometime after this, and for accommodating all differences between them, Proposals were made to the Dutchess, which after long agitation, on 28th of <hi>April,</hi> 1694. were reduced into writing, and executed by the Duke and Dutchess: The preamble of which Articles is in the words following. <hi>Whereas diverse Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, Debates, Demands, and Suits of several natures have for some time since been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated, and continued between the said Duke and the said Dutchess his Wife,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>unto all which it is at last held fitting (it being conducible to their respective quiets and ease) to have an end put, and the like for the future prevented. It is therefore hereby and by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to these presents declared and agreed in manner following;</hi> Whereby the Dutchess convey'd to the Duke's use the Mannor of <hi>Castle Rising,</hi> &amp;c. And also the said Dutchess and her Trustees assigned their Interest in a considerable part of the Mannor of <hi>Sheffield</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> to the use of the said Duke. So that by these Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and that Deed executed thereupon, the Duke had his then desired Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
            <p>That after the execution of these Articles, the Dutchess sent for one Mr <hi>Negus</hi> the Dukes principal Gentleman, and expressed herself very sensible of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of the <hi>Duke</hi> and her <hi>self,</hi> and desired Mr <hi>Negus</hi> to tell the Duke, that she would avoid all Company that should give him any offence, and that she would not so much as pay a Visit, but where he liked; which Mr <hi>Negus</hi> lately testified before the Lords, and that he acquainted the Duke with it, as also that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:204991:25"/> she had several times told him, if she Dyed first, she would leave the Duke her Estate.</p>
            <p>That notwithstanding the said Agreements, whereby the Duke and Dutchess agreed to live Separately, yet without his signifying any Dissatisfaction to or with the Dutchess, and without any manner of Notice, or previous proceeding in the common and ordinary Course of Justice, but by taking from her that Legal Tryal in the Ecclesiastical Court, which by the Laws of this Realm she is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled unto, he did on the 16th day of <hi>February</hi> last exhibit in the House of Peers the Bill now depending for Dissolving the Dukes Marriage with the Dutchess, and for enabling him to Marry again. Upon which the proceedings were so very quick, two Foreigners (<hi>a</hi> French <hi>Foot-man and a</hi> Dutch <hi>Cook maid</hi>) lately brought from beyond Sea, being forthwith examined against her, charging her with Facts supposed to be committed many years since, and long before the date of the said Agreement, and on which the two former Bills were founded, that it was impossible for her to make her Defence as she might have done, if the proceedings had been against her according to the known Laws of this Land.</p>
            <p>The Dutchess thought herself under a necessity of complying with all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the House of Peers, and accordingly as well as she could, made her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, tho less than a weeks time was allowed her for doing it, and upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Evidence of the Dukes Witnesses, many contradictions appeared, some whereof follow, as doth appear by the depositions taken in Writing, and now remaining in the House of Peers.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Hauseur</hi> the Footman swears the Dutchess was at the <hi>Cock-Pit,</hi> when and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he came to live with Sir <hi>John Germaine,</hi> and that he continued there fifteen days after, and that after the Dutchess left the <hi>Cock-pit</hi> she went to <hi>Fox hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vanness</hi> the Cook-maid swears <hi>Hauseur</hi> came to Sir <hi>John</hi> when the Dutchess was at <hi>Foxhall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hauseur</hi> swears that 8th <hi>Feb.</hi> 92 he left Sir <hi>Johns</hi> service, when the Tryal was between the Duke and Dutchess in Parliament, and afterlived privately six or eight weeks, till he and <hi>Vanness</hi> could get for <hi>Holland,</hi> and arrived there in <hi>Easter</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>And yet in another place he swore he desired leave to go, and afterwards that he also went for <hi>Holland</hi> as soon as the wind was fair.</p>
            <p>But note, all the Evidence was closed and ordered to be summed up the 9th of <hi>February,</hi> so that he need not afterwards to have gone. And whereas he insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates that he and <hi>Vanness</hi> were secreted and kept from being Witnesses:</p>
            <p>Note, it doth no where appear, that either he or <hi>Vanness</hi> were ever thought on for Witnesses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hauseur</hi> swears he returned again to Sir <hi>John</hi> in Summer 92, being often sent to by Sir <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>Bayly</hi> an other of the Dukes Witnesses, swears he did not return again to Sir <hi>John</hi> in two years after he went away, <hi>Bayly</hi> the witness being all that time and three years before, a Servant in the House.</p>
            <p>Note also, that this very Summer 92, to wit, in <hi>Easter</hi> Term, the Duke brought his Action against Sir <hi>John,</hi> which was tried <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term 92, at which time it had been more likely, if Sir <hi>John</hi> had believed he could have done him any harm, he should have kept him in <hi>Holland,</hi> rather than have sent for him over, especially considering that this fellow afterwards swears Sir <hi>John</hi> swore in a rage this fellow would betray him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hauseur</hi> being asked who sent for <hi>Vanness</hi> over,</p>
            <p>He answered, that after he had promised the Duke and Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> to speak the truth of what he knew, they desired him if he met <hi>Vanness</hi> to desire her to come over, and speak the truth of what she knew.</p>
            <p>And being ask'd how long after he met <hi>Vanness,</hi> answer'd about 12 months since.</p>
            <p>And being ask'd when was the first time he spoke to her, about her coming o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to speak the truth, answered, 'tis about a year since.</p>
            <p>And being asked how long it was since they resolved to come over, answer'd, 12 months.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vanness</hi> being asked whether she was not sent for from <hi>Holland</hi> to be a witness,</p>
            <p>Answered, she knew nothing of it, till eight or nine weeks ago.</p>

                  </gap>ess</hi> Swears she was sent away on account of the Tryal.</p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>Peacock, Hawkesworth,</hi> and <hi>Knight,</hi> three Servants of the <hi>Dutchess,</hi> Swore the <hi>Dutchess</hi> turn'd her away before the Tyral, for keeping company with <hi>Dutch</hi> Souldiers, and they do Swear a new Cook maid there before the Tryal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hauseur</hi> Swears he had a Key of the door going into the <hi>Park,</hi> and could come in when he would,</p>
            <p>And yet owns, he knew but two of the Servants, one whereof is long since dead.</p>
            <p>And also the Dutchesses Servants swear they never heard any body had a Key, and that if any Key had been, they must have known of it; they also prove the Shutting up, Bolting and Chaining the door every night, and Opening it every morning, and but one of the Servants remembers ever to have seen him at the door, and then he rung the Bell, but came only to see a Country woman of his, and to carry Letters to <hi>Holland,</hi> and brought answer back to her, but was not admitted beyond the passage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hauseur</hi> and <hi>Vanness</hi> Swear they saw the <hi>Dutchess</hi> and Sir <hi>John</hi> in Bed together at <hi>Millbank.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dutchesses Woman swore she has put the Dutchess to Bed, and taken her up every night and morning several years, and never saw him in the House. And two others swear they were constantly in waiting night and morning, and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively deny any knowledge of any such thing, and say they never saw <hi>Hauseur</hi> there, and that <hi>Vanness</hi> was never admitted up stairs, she was so dirty a creature, much less to dress or undress the Dutchess, as she pretended often to have done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vanness</hi> swears she could not tell the places she has been at these six weeks last past. Whereas</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>May,</hi> and two other of the Dukes servants, Swear she has been fourteen days in the Dukes own house, with the full liberty of the House.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vanness</hi> being asked whether she ever told any body of the occasion of her going away, she swore yes, she told it to a great many in <hi>Holland,</hi> and not here.</p>
            <p>Yet being afterwards asked whether she ever discovered that she was sent out of the way, she swore directly no.</p>
            <p>These are some of the many plain Contradictions and Disproofs of these Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences; besides the great improbability in their own nature, in several things sworn.</p>
            <p>But it is also to be noted, that <hi>Hauseur</hi> left Sir <hi>John</hi>'s service in a disgust, and so it is proved by <hi>Baily</hi> another of the Dukes Witnesses, and that what <hi>Hauseur</hi> swore could be nothing but Spight and Malice. Yea, it is proved on the Dutchesses part, that he swore he would find a way to be revenged of him, and that perhaps it might not be long first; and Mr <hi>Strange,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Pitts,</hi> and her two Maids, who could have deposed very materially for the Dutchess refused to appear, tho often summoned; being persons not in the Dutchesses Interest or Power.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Hauseur</hi> has been out of place ever since he left Sir <hi>John</hi>'s service, <hi>April</hi> 96. and is so still, as he Swears And so in consequence likely to be necessitous.</p>
            <p>Note also, that <hi>Hauseur</hi> swears Sir <hi>John</hi> gave him seven Guineas to pay the charges of himself, <hi>Vanness</hi> and another, which were ordered to be kept private, till they could be shipp'd off, and also for their passage into <hi>Holland,</hi> which was in time from the 8th of <hi>Feb.</hi> 92. till <hi>Easter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which does not look like a Bribe for a secret of this nature, being hardly suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to maintain three people, and pay their Lodgings, for two months.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hauseur</hi> would be thought a mighty Confident, so as to have a Key to the Dutchesses house, to come in and go out when he pleased; and yet, as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted as he pretended to be with the House, and the Dutchesses Bed-chamber, he could not tell on what Floor it was, nor what Furniture it had; nor whether Wainscotted or Hanged. And when he was asked, which way the Windows of the Bed chamber looked, he trifled in that Question, and concluded he could see the Water, but was affraid to go near the Window for fear of being discovered, and yet had no scruple of coming into the house with his Key at any time.</p>
            <p>These things being observed, it must be consider'd, that the Facts now in effect charg'd against the Dutchess, are suggested to be done many years since, and were debated and considered before the Peers, before the rejection of the two first Bills, and long before the agreement for putting an end to all Controversies and Debates. Now 'tis very hard to put the <hi>Dutchess</hi> to account again, for those
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:204991:26"/> very Facts, considering that after eight or nine years, many people are dead, others dispersed, and not in a little time to be found out. and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of times and places (which in the nature of all these Cases is almost all that is left to discover a Falsity) forgot.</p>
            <p>The Dutchess is also under the unavoidable necessity of proving a Negative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst downright Swearing, and that without any matter Introductory, and also by two mean Servants, the one turned out of her place for keeping company with Foot Souldiers, and the other leaving his place in disgust, because he could not have the Play Money.</p>
            <p>Masters are already too much in the power of their Servants, and if they charge their Masters with Adultery, Felony, and even Treason, it is not easily in the power of the Master to defend himself against downright Swearing; Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants having those opportunities of the knowledge of times and places and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, which cannot be denied or avoided, and which others have not, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they may frame and build false Evidence, and many times are of ill Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and desperate Fortunes, and of tempers very Revengeful, so that whoever turns away a Servant, he is in his power for his Estate, Honour, and even Life itself. And therefore for the safety and freedom of Families, in other Countries they are not permitted to be Evidence against their Masters in any matter crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Note also, that the Dutchess thinks she as an <hi>English</hi> Subjects has by <hi>Magna Carta</hi> the same right to a Tryal in the legal and ordinary was of Justice, as the rest of the Kings Subjects, especially considering that there never yet was in <hi>England</hi> one Precedent, of a Bill exhibited in Parliament to dissolve a Marriage at the first instance, without any previous proceedings in the Ecclesiastical Courts; (which in these Cases is the Law of the Land) and not above five or six Bills, in above 600 years, ever passed to dissolve Marriages, or make Second Marriages good, even after there had been a Divorce in the Spiritual Courts, and those Bills too in Cases generally where the Husbands were without any recrimination.</p>
            <p>No Impediment appears why the Duke should not have endeavoured a Divorce at Law, before he had attempted a Bill to dissolve the Marriage. For any Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the <hi>Legislature</hi> for tryal of matters of private right is improper, because there are proper Judicatures, that give that remedy the Law allows.</p>
            <p>To ask any thing of the <hi>Legislature,</hi> in private Causes between party and party, beyond what the known Laws in force give, seems to be improper, because,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is to make a Law in one persons case, which is not the Law in anothers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is to retrospect actions, and after the Fact to augment or alter the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Our Laws are certain and known, that persons may conform their actions to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Courts and Forms of Law are equally the Subjects right with the Law, and the application to the <hi>Legislature,</hi> takes away all that right of Form and Charging, whereas a certainty in time to answer, and exceptions to witnesses, and other Legal defences of the Fact, cannot be denied the meanest Subject.</p>
            <p>The consequence that short and summary ways of proceedings may have on the Settlements of Estates and Families, may be very dangerous, and tho the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi>'s Bill passed the House of Peers, yet a great number of the Peers both Spiritual and Temporal, entred their protest against its passing, and their reasons for it.</p>
            <p>It ought to be no prejudice to the Dutchess, that the next Heir presumptive to the Duke doth not as yet appear to be a Protestant, because when a Bill which hath lately passed both Houses is become a Law, it is not likely that noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily will be without a Protestant at the head of it.</p>
            <p>If any of the witnesses formerly examined on the Bill in 1691. be now again produced, it is humbly apprehended, that as the validity of their testimony they then gave was totally overthrown, by a greater number of witnesses, so it will be again, tho under the disadvantage of the great distance of time.</p>

            <p>It is a Bill not only to Divorce the Dutchess upon a very short warning, who hath been a Wife twenty three Years, but to render her Infamous to all Posterity by Act of Parliament, which I accompt to be the greatest Misfortune possible to befal any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and at the same time it takes from her the legal Tryal of the Fact whereof she is accused, and which she hath a right to by the Law of the Land, sure as much as the meanest Subject; and which we don't apprehend she has in any wise forfeited, nor is there any reason assigned, why his Grace has not been pleased to proceed in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Course. I hope, Sir, you will take notice also, that this is in truth, nothing but a Suit between Party and Party. 'Tis meerly a Cause Matrimonial between Husband and Wife, began originally in the House of Peers, and as hitherto the beginning of Causes between Party and Party, in that House hath been strongly opposed, so I hope it will be thought reasonable to do so always, because it deprives the Subject of that Legal Defence due to him by the Law of the Land. If this was always complained of, when the Proceedings were in a Judicial way, surely 'tis a great deal worse to begin there a private Cause between Party and Party in the Legislative way. I can see no manner of difference with respect to the loss of those great Advantages the Party is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled to, only this seems rather to be the most against reason.</p>
            <p>Sir, this is a summary Proceeding with a Witness. It began but the 16. of <hi>February,</hi> and but a Weeks time was given to the Party accused of so high a Crime, and of so great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence to the Party accused, to be heard to it; and tho perhaps we may with reason enough find fault with the tedious proceedings in some Courts, where Appeals and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:204991:27"/> Writs of Error are justly due, as where Property is well fixed, it must needs be reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. I say, from various Causes, though Suits in the Ordinary Courts are very tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet I am sure a Summary way of proceeding without due warning, or any certain way of making Defence by any known rules, and without Oath, as here without Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, without any possibility of retrieving the matter again, with great submission, and if this must be for all that one has in the World, such a Summary way is a very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thing.</p>
            <p>I would be glad any one would make it his own Case, and think with themselves how they should like it, if their Life, Estate, and all they had, were put upon such a Summary way of proceeding. 'Tis true, in some Kingdoms where the Government is Arbitrary, the Proceedings are summarily, and most commonly they go together; and if we were in a place where the Judges were infallible, and there were no False Witnesses, and Truth could be discovered at an instant, a Summary way would be best; but since Men are fallible, since there is Passion and Partiality in the World, since oftentimes there is notorious Detections of Perjury, and several things are difficult to be disclosed, and require a reasonable time for examining into Facts; from thence it is that there are settled Courses for determining all Questions in <hi>England</hi> between Party and Party; and there are known Rules and good Methods, for the relieving against any ill Judgment that is given.</p>
            <p>Whatever you may think of this particular Case of the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk;</hi> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is of mighty consequence to all Parents, that perhaps make hard shift to give their Daughters considerable Portions, and may think they have married them well, and made Provision for them and their Children. I say it will be hard, if their Daughters should be sent home to them upon a Fortnights warning, and that Witnesses should be examined against them, without their having notice so much as of the places of their Abode. And a thing should be determined before the Witnesses can be well known, and it must be agreed to be of great Consequence to all Collateral Heirs, if Marriages are so easily and suddenly set aside for want of Issue, which I find to be one of the Causes assigned for this Bill, and that it may be in a Summary way, perhaps, before they can well hear of it. I am sure, this is a matter of too great Temptation to be put upon Men that may grow weary of their Wives, and desire a better Fortune, or desire Change, or may be moved by a thousand Reasons we can't think off, to revive old Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and think of things long since passed, if you will set such a Precedent of Divorcing in such a Summary way.</p>
            <p>This is sure of infinite concern to us in higher matters. A Bill of Divorce of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in Parliament, without a Legal Tryal, is just the same thing as a Bill of Attainder against a Man for Treason; the one forfeits the Estate, corrupts the Blood, and takes away his Life, and the other does very little less: For I find according to the Bill, 'tis to forfeit her Joynture, to defame her Person, corrupt her Reputation; and though it leave her Life, it is left with Infamy, which is worse than Death, and in a Case of this high moment, sure you will be careful how you alter the course of Trials. I beseech you, Sir, will not the reason be the same, that a Bill of Attainder may be brought against a Man, and that Witnesses against him may be fetched from beyond Sea, which he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly discharged from his Service, and put the other side to prove what is always very difficult, the Negative, to make his Defence, which must needs require a reasonable time for the making out of Circumstances, and laying Evidence together; where will be the difference between proceeding against a Man for his Life without a Tryal, and proceeding against a Woman for her Joynture, where her Name, Family, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, is concern'd, and perhaps her Children, the ligitimacy of whom must come in question; and in a Case, where the Person by no behaviour of hers hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited such a Tryal, nor the Person that Prosecutes this Bill, can't shew, that he hath been obstructed in his proceeding in the ordinary way. I need not take notice of what every body knows, that we have a happy Constitution, if we can keep it, every Man can call his Wife his own, and his Estate his own, because it can't be taken away, but by Legal Tryal; but if you will go into these extraordinary resorts, when the Courts and the Law is open, without any previous Preparations for that Matter, by having a fair Examination, that the Party can't say there is a surprize, I know not where it will end; and though in one case it may be desirable that there should be an extraordinary Relief; but will this go no farther? Can any body say that?</p>
            <p>That which we find in <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is not to be forgot, where there is so much care in the several instances of it for the preserving of Property, and the Right of Tryals, <hi>Quod nullus destruatur, nec super eum ibimus, nec super eum mittemus, nisi per legale judicium parium suorum vel per legem terrae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why, in this Case the Ecclesiastical Law, is <hi>Lex Terrae.</hi> And if that be to be taken away without any Reason, why may not the Law in any other Case.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:204991:27"/>
            <p>We have perhaps in time of great Emergency and Publick difficulties, had some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Laws grounded on Extraordinary Reasons, but now we are in a time of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled Peace, when there may be a just determination according to the Law of the Land, I can't see any reason for this proceeding, no not in this particular case.</p>
            <p>I would Sir with your favour, take notice of those few Instances of this kind, that have been in <hi>England</hi> by Act of Parliament, and in what manner they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
            <p>There have not passed hardly Six in Six hundred years, I think I may challenge them on the other side to shew so great a number, but those I have I shall quote: But they Proceed d in another manner than this had done.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, where Persons have had a fair Tryal in a proper Court, and Witnesses have been Examined, and Sentence final been pronounced, and where the party as to the fact hath been concluded according to the Law of the Land, when all this hath passed, some Instances there have been, that afterwards an Act of Parliament has passed to strengthen the Sentence, and to carry it farther than the Ecclesiastical Courts will allow, even to the dissolving the Marriage, and Enabling the Innocent Person to Marry again, but you will find all those Acts are founded and built upon the Sentence in those Courts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite those Sentences as a great inducement to the passing of those Acts, and I crave leave just to take notice of those. The first we find, is that made in the Case of the <hi>Marquess</hi> of <hi>Northampton,</hi> which was in 5 <hi>E.</hi> 6. He was Married to a Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and she Eloped from him, and was prosecuted in the Ecclesiastical Courts, and there was Sentence against her of Divorce. The <hi>Marquess</hi> from hence took upon him to Marry a Daughter of the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and after Four Years Marriage of her he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an Act of Parliament to ratify the Second Marriage, which Act recites a settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Divorce in the Ecclesiastical Court.</p>
            <p>This took its rise from Examination according to Law, and that Act of Parliament is grounded upon it, and recites it as a previous matter necessary to induce that Act.</p>
            <p>The next that follow's was the famous Case of the Lord <hi>Ross,</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> though there perhaps was as great a notoriety of Fact as can be pretended in this Case, and he did not stand impeached of any immodest behaviour, but even in that case the Divorce by the Act, followed a Divorce in the Ecclesiastical Court, and that passed with such Difficulty that it was Four Years in hand, it began in Sixty Six, and was not passed till Seventy. I have a Copy of it; and it says that forasmuch as <hi>Mannors</hi> commonly call'd L. <hi>Ross.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it proceeds thereupon to Enable him to Marry again, but this Sir could not be but by two Acts of Parliament, besides the Sentence in the Ecclesiastical Court, for he first got that Court to declare the Children illegimate, and then in the year (70) the Parliament passed this Act.</p>
            <p>I know of no other till we come to a case that happened within our Memory, 'tis the Case of a Person of great worth, and I hope it will give no offence when I cite the Precedent.</p>
            <p>It was the Case of Mr. <hi>Lukenor,</hi> who had been grosly abused by his Wife, by Elope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and open Adultery, but the Act he obtained went no farther than to disable the Children born while she lived in open Adultery, and that Act recites a Sentence of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, I have the Copy of it, and I crave leave I may read a few lines of it, It recites that Mr. <hi>Lukenors</hi> Wife had Eloped from her Husband.</p>
            <p>There was indeed a famous case not long agoe of a Lady that was taken away by Force, and pretended to be Married, and an Act of Parliament came afterwards to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that Marriage Null and Void, but even there was a proceeding at Law with a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. The Person that had been concerned, was actually Indicted and Executed, it was not there to make a Divorce, and so it had been a Vain thing to have gone into the Spiritual Court, where there was no Marriage, for it was only a Law after the Fact Declaratory by way of Caution, to give the more satisfaction that that Marriage was Null and Void.</p>
            <p>Sir, the last I know of (and it may be proper for you to observe how quick these Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple come after it) was that of a Noble Earl, that did obtain last Parliament, an Act for Divorcing him and his Lady. It is the Case of the Earl of <hi>Macclesfield,</hi> but in that Case it will be proper to take notice to you, that there were previous proceedings in the Ecclesiastical Court, there was a Libell exhibited against her, a charge upon her, and Witnesses examined, and she had a fair Opportunity of making her Defence, there was a Regular and a long Proceeding against her, and a Prosecution of her, in order to a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication, and then there came the Earls Petition into the House of Peers, setting forth that there had been such a Proceeding as this, and that she stood in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, having been Prosecuted as far as that Court could go, after an Examination of Winesses, in all the Cases I have heard of a Divorce by Act of Parliament, there have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:204991:28"/> been Proceedings in the Ecclesiastical Court, this was the way of former times, but now we are beginning where the matter ought to End.</p>
            <p>And now the first Application is to that place, wherein all these Instances (as I think it ought to be) was the last resort. 'Tis true this Method may not please the Duke, for we know his Grace is in hast, and for cutting the knot a sunder, at once by the Legislative Power, but I hope upon these Precedents, you will think it more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it should be at first untyed, or at least Loosen'd by a Judicial Proceeding. If you will, I do not see how in Justice the Parliament can deny the like Remedy the next Sessions to any other that may be in the like case, it may be in worse, for here is no pretence of any Spurious Issue; can the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> whence we take our measures of Justice, deny the like remedy in Justice to any others that are in the like Case? What is it that guards you from an infinite application of this Nature, but requiring Persons to take the ordinary course first, and to come round about to the Parliament, as the last Remedy, to carry the Sentence perhaps farther than the Ecclesastical Court can do, but if Persons may come up directly hither, I am apt to think your Lobby will be crowded with Petitioners of this nature the next Sessions, though the Sessions now are long and frequent, this single business may be so great as to obstruct all other business, I am sure a Committee for Adultery would have a full Employment.</p>
            <p>Let it be consider'd how strange it would be if some Poor Man upon this precedent, shall come and make Application, and tell you he stands in need of such a Bill from the condition of his Family, that his Wife Plunders his House, sells his Goods, and lives in Adultery, and pray this matter may be examined in a Summary way, because he is not able to go through the costly course of Ecclesiastical Courts, and be favoured with a Divorce; would not this Poor Mans Case seem to have the like Justice, or possibly more, and yet if such a mean Man should come with such a Petition, perhaps it would look strange, and yet in Justice there is no respect of Persons, the Law in <hi>England</hi> is <hi>Ʋnum pondus &amp; una mensura,</hi> and if this should be done in the Case of a great and Rich Man, and not for a Poor Man, they may say what hath been said by some, That our Laws are like the Spiders web, which only holds the Lesser Insects.</p>
            <p>Shall those that expect the best Fortunes and greatest Advantage by Marriage, not undergoe the bad Fortune of Marriage too? I am sure if this be so, it's a Privilege of Peerage, never thought of before.</p>
            <p>You may see Sir by this Bill how Precedents grow upon you; at first in the Case of the <hi>Marquess</hi> of <hi>Northampton,</hi> it was hard to get an Act after a Divorce: So it was in the Case of my Lord <hi>Rose;</hi> the last Sessions, in the Case of the Earl of <hi>Macclesfield</hi> it went farther there, because there had been a previous proceeding in the Ecclesiastical Court, and his Lady had Obstructed that Sentence, that Act passed before Sentence, but now we are come to have it done without so much as a Tryal to get a Divorce in the Ecclesiastical Courts, to have all passed at once in a Summary way, it will be but to Petition the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all shall be determined without a possibility of being reheard.</p>
            <p>I know nothing can be said on the other side with good reason (unless that which I heard in another place) why they should not go to the Ecclesiastical Court, which is that those Courts cannot Divorce a <hi>Vinculo</hi> Matrimony, therefore it would have been a vain thing; this may be a good Reason for them to come to you afterwards, but 'tis no Reason for them to come here at first, unless they will say at the same time, that every thing ought to be begun in Parliament, because 'tis possible every thing may be brought to the House of Peers at last, will they say that all Ejectments ought to be begun Originally in the House of Peers, because after the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have been at great charge and trouble in the Courts below, they may be brought thither by Writ of Error at the last. This would have been a good Expedient, in a cause lately where a Deed was Tryed over and over, if the Persons concerned in so many Verdicts, had once thought of having begun in Parliament to have had it settled, whether it was a just Deed or no, if this be the rule, it would be well it were known, and made to be the Law of the Kingdom, for that Law will be always reckoned heard which is made in one Case, if it may not be had in another, the Law of <hi>England</hi> does go throughout, and if it be Law for one 'tis for another: I have but one thing more to lay before you, and that seems worthy of your consideration, besides all that I have said.</p>
            <p>You observe the Bill is General without Restraint, of Time and Place, or Description, or Circumstances relating to the Fact; now, Sir, I must take leave to acquaint you, that so long agoe as <hi>April,</hi> 1694. his Grace the Duke, who complains of this matter, as if some new misfortune had befallen him, having made former Complaints and Attempts for obtaining what he now desires, did at last in <hi>April,</hi> 1694. not suddenly, but by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Council, with his Friends about him, after a long time of agitation come to Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles with his Wife the Dutchess, of which I crave leave only to Read the Preamble.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:204991:28"/>
            <p>The Articles are between his Grace the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terborough,</hi> and recites. —</p>
            <p>It is therefore determined by the Parties, and agreed as followeth, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Articles proceed to settle every thing between the Duke and Dutchess,<note place="margin">Vide her printed Case ut infra.</note> to his own Satisfaction, and according to his own Desire; His Grace hath Reaped the benefit of those Articles, by having received a great Sum of Money, and the Dutchess parted with her Interest in that great and Noble Mannor of <hi>Sheffeild,</hi> his Grace hath had all that he on his part was to have, and hath Executed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Deeds pursuant to this agreement: Now if after all this there be a Prospect of farther Advantage by another Marriage, that will not move you to give him a liberty for a departure from so Solemn Agreement, in what a Condition are People that have Purchased their Peace as the Dutchess has, if they may have Liberty to go back beyond this, for the Bill has no stint; surely all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, between Men and their Wives, and all Acts towards them, and all Acts of kindness are to be favoured, and matters of a Divorce are of an odious Nature, and not to be Encouraged after such composure of Differences and Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We have Instances of some that have taken their Wives again, and lived Comfortably afterwards; surely it shall not be in their power to go back and say, Pray let us be Divorced. 'Tis contrary to the use of all Acts of Pardon, what is the End of all Acts of Parliament, of General Pardon, and all Statutes of Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but to ease People in such a Case, for 'tis impossible that any person can be able to Defend their Actions, Nine or Ten Years agoe, they can't keep their Witnesses alive, and therefore the Law hath often limited a time, beyond which Persons shall not go back, and this we think the Duke hath done by Articles, and surely they are Conclusive both before God and Man.</p>
            <p>I shall say no more, but that I don't apprehend the Nation will be in any great Danger. If the Duke do betwixt this and the next Session, proceed in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Course, and prepare matters against another Session, I am sure 'tis of Great consequence; no Man can deny, but we have a good constitution, but if it is in the Case of a particular Person, to be broken, such a breach in this Constitution may not be very easily recover'd.</p>
            <p>I hope this Cause that is precipitated here out of time, and before those Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were made, that have been in all others Cases, shall be remitted to its proper place, where her Grace will give the Duke a Meeting, if they be not before that reconciled.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dodd.</hi> Mr. <hi>Speaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I desire the favour of a word of the same side. These Bills are not common, I think there are not above three Instances to be found in the Records of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>This Bill is to Dissolve a Marriage after Twenty three Years continuance, and that not upon so many Days Notice, as there have been Years of the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, for to serve the particular purposes of one Person, 'tis a Law after the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Fact committed, the Law should go first, and the Fact follow, it is not a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Law, for all the People of <hi>England,</hi> as such it would have another Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, there is no occasion for particular Law, 'tis a Bill from the Lords, and in a little time for what I know, the Lords will prescribe to it, there is not one of these Bills for a Commoner, unless in my Lord <hi>Ross</hi>'s Case, who was of a Noble Family.</p>
            <p>'Tis not pretended by this Bill, that the Dutchess hath had any Spurious Issue, though that was the Circumstances of one of the Bills that did pass, and that was a Material Circumstance in the Case, and that is not alledged here. These Bills are not to be made use off, but upon extraordinary occasions, and the utmost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and till then I hope such Bills shall not be made use off, and we think the Proceeding upon this Bill, in this Case will appear much harder; for 'tis the first Instance of this Nature, when there has been no Proceeding in any Court what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, to convict the Dutchess of this Offence, no citation all this while in the Ecclesiastical Courts, where the Dutchess might have an Opportunity to make her Defence.</p>
            <p>If those Courts have Jurisdiction in any one thing, 'tis in Case of Matrimony, if this was brought into those Courts, the Dutchess would be allowed to make her Defence, not only by way of Recrimination, but Examination of Witnesses; a Commission might be had to Examine Witnesses beyond Sea, if she had any Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses there, or in the Country; she might appeal to a Superiour Court, and thence to the Delegates; these are all proper Defences that the Law allows, that there
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:204991:29"/> may be no surprize upon the Party; and if injured, he may be righted in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place; these Proceedings we think are necessary to go before a Bill of this Nature, for then the Fact would be plain, and if the Dutchess had been convicted in this manner, as to the Fact we must not have opened our Mouths against it.</p>
            <p>By the same Reason that a Bill is brought to Dissolve this Marriage, in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time you may have a Bill to marry People. Be it enacted for such and such Reasons, such Persons shall be married, this would be a much readier way in Case of Contracts, than any Proceedings in the Ecclesiastical Courts. And though they may say the Law of <hi>England</hi> takes notice of Contracts of Matrimony, as well as any other Acts, that is, no Answer; for the Fact is, whether there is any Contract of Matrimony, or no; and so 'tis here, Whether my Lady is guilty of the Crimes charged here in the Bill, and for this she ought to have a proper Tryal, and ought to be called to an Account in the ordinary Methods of Law, and then it might be proper to carry the Sentence farther than those Courts can. I hope you will be very tender of making a new precedent, and I do not know of any Bill before this to convict a Woman of a supposed Crime; then this is the first Bill of this Nature, and you will consider, whether you will make a precedent of it (or no) though this before you is the Case of a Great and Honourable Person, yet your Justice will be the same, if it should happen that any other Man in the Kingdom should be in the same Circumstances, and willing to slip over all Tryals, whereby the Person accused might have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of making her just Defence, as is the Case of this Noble Lady, who is hurried on after twenty three years Marriage to a Determination, in as many Days in this extraordinary manner.</p>
            <p>I hope therefore you will not proceed in a Bill of this extraordinary Nature, of which there is not one instance to be given, where you have begun to examine a supposed Crime, but you have always left it to the Determination of the Law in the ordinary Course, and we think it ought the rather to be so in this Case, because 'tis not pretended by the Bill, that there is any stop put to their proceedings there; there is no absence of Witnesses, no incapacity, but his Grace may proceed there to convict this Lady of the Crime he supposes her guilty of, and she will there have her just Defence, and till then there is no Crime for you to judge upon; and I hope you will think fit to Reject this Bill.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Pinfold,</hi> Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I desire to speak a few words as to the Ecclesiastical Law, which is a part of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> as much as any other, for our Law does not receive <hi>Majus &amp; Minus;</hi> and the Ecclesiastical Courts have been settled for several Ages, and are governed by such Rules, which every Subject hath a Right to. Sir, This Bill is to Dissolve the Bond of Marriage, and to give leave to Marry again; and I crave leave to shew the House what our Ecclesiastical Constitutions are in that Case, and how tender they have been in that Point, and how those Constitutions are grounded upon the Cannons and Decrees of Councils.</p>
            <p>The Cases where the Bond of Marriage is to be dissolved, are but few, and they arise before Marriage; 'tis in the case of the Precontract, or Nonage, or Consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity, and there the Bond is broken by the Sentence of the Judge, and the Person hath liberty to Marry again; but for what comes afterwards, whether it be the Case of Adultery, or any thing else, the Law Ecclesiastical, which as I said before, is part of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> hath been very careful not to Dissolve the Marriage.</p>
            <p>The 48th Canon says, If any Lay-man shall put away his Wife, and marry ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he shall be excommunicated; That was the Sense of those early Days, and sure they did not think it an indifferent matter, because they punished it with so heavy a Punishment. So it was in the Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> 314. and there it was decreed, that if a Man took his Wife in Adultery, he should be forbidden to Marry: There, what was to be done? Counsel should be given him not to Marry while she lived, though she was an Adultress.</p>
            <p>And in the Council, 402. the <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> Evangelical, Apostolical Council, it was decreed, That if a Man was divorced from his Wife, or a Wife from her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, there they were not to Marry, but should remain unmarried, or be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</p>
            <p>And in the <hi>African</hi> Council, Canon 102. there it was provided, That they who were divorced, whether it was a Husband from his Wife, or Wife from her Husband, they should remain unmarried. This was the Sence of the Ancient Canons and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:204991:29"/> Councils, and this is received into our Ecclesiastical Constitution. In the 15. Year of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in the Chapter of Divorces, 'tis said, That upon a Sentence of Divorce, there must be an Admonition, and a Prohibition, that the Party shall not Marry again.</p>
            <p>And in the Year 1602. in the beginning of King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, there was a farther Provision made to keep them from being married again, and that was this, That they should give Bond and Security they should not Marry again, this is certainly our Ecclesiastical Constitution, and grounded on the Sense of the Ancient Canons.</p>
            <p>Now it remains to shew some Advantage this would have had, if she had had the Tryal, which of common Right is due to the meanest Subject, she would have had the advantage of Challenges, which she can't have here, for here the Evidence must drop from the Witnesses Mouths, who are Foreigners, and have been long absent; there they must give an Account of themselves, which here hath not been done by any body. This Lady might have given her Exceptions to those Witnesses, and had a Commission into <hi>Holland,</hi> to have examined how these Witnesses have behaved themselves, and whether these Persons were to be believed and credited; here she would likewise have liberty to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how this Design began. I do now speak with respect to the Duke, but I do say it does seem to have began a year and a half ago. She would likewise have had the advantage of a thorough Reconciliation; and here are some Deeds in (94.) between the Duke and the Dutchess, which I hope, if the House will take an account of, will have its due effect; she would likewise have had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of an Appeal, the common Right of the Subject, and grounded upon good Reason; and in case there hath been a neglect in the first Instances, the Party may be righted in another place.</p>
            <p>By this Bill she is debarr'd of the advantage of Recrimination, to which she hath a Right, for the Text Law is —</p>
            <p>And the Text Law, <hi>de Divortiis,</hi> is the same, were the Charge most true, which we do not admit; yet if she can prove the same thing against her Husband, the fault of one must be set against the fault of another, and he can't have the advantage of his Prayer.</p>
            <p>I shall repeat only one thing more, and that is the Case quoted already of the Earl of <hi>Macclesfield,</hi> but in that Case the Lady withdrew her self five or six days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sentence; yet there the Lady <hi>Macclesfield</hi> had all her Defences, and even her Recriminations, and had a time to prove it; there was Publication, and a day set down for Sentence, but she spun out the time till the Parliament was ready to rise, and then my Lord's Friends advised him to begin in Parliament; and when the Lords were acquainted of my Lady <hi>Macclesfield</hi>'s standing in contempt of the Court, and she was prosecuted so far, that she was almost ready to go to Prison for her Contempt, then the House of Lords did think fit to receive my Lord <hi>Macclesfield</hi>'s Bill, and not before; but before my Lord <hi>Macclesfield</hi> brought his Bill in Parliament, there was nothing remained to be done in the Ecclesiastical Courts, but Sentence. And I hope for all these Reasons you will not proceed upon this Bill.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Serg. Wright.</hi> Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I am of Councel for the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who is your Suppliant for this Bill, for redress against the highest Injury that can be offered; the Rights of his Marriage Bed have been Invaded, and he comes for that Relief here, which no other Court can afford him; for the Learned Doctor on the otherside, tells you plainly from the Canon Law, that there can be no Divorce; a <hi>Vinculo Matrimoni</hi> in their Courts, now to send us to a Court for Relief, that they tell us before hand can give us none, is in effect to tell us we shall have none at all.</p>
            <p>The Bill is founded upon the Suggestions contained in the first Three or Four lines in the Bill, that the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> hath for divers Years lived in Separation from the Duke her Husband, and hath had unlawful Familiarity, and Adultrous Conversation with Sir <hi>John Germain,</hi> and is Guilty of Adultery on her part, and hath broken the Bond of Matrimony; these are the Reasons for which the Duke desires this Bill may pass; 'tis for the Adulterous Conversation of the Dutchess, not for one single Act, but a continual Series of the like Acts for many Years; for we shall not give only one single Act or Instance in Evidence, but prove this Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation for several Years, beginning in Eighty Seven, and carry'd on to the latter end of Ninety Five.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:204991:30"/>
            <p>It hath been objected that this is the first Instance, of a Divorce, the first Bill of this kind, where there has been no Proceedings in the Spiritual Court; that 'tis the first Bill of this kind, we deny, but that there have been no Proceedings in the Spiritual Court we own, for the Earl of <hi>Macclesfield</hi>'s, was the same to all intents and purposes, as this is; for though 'tis true, they had been in the Spiritual Court, yet 'tis as true, they came here into Parliament, before any Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the Spiritual Court; now to what Purpose is it to go into the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Court, and not to stay for the Determination of that Court; if the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Court is to have any weight, in the Case of the Earl of <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesfield,</hi> 'tis true, they had been there and Examined Witnesses on one side, with all precipitation, yet would they not stay for a Sentence there, but quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their own Proceedings, and came to the Parliament, now I do take it that they had better never been there, than to have come away before Sentence, for when they were in the Spiritual Court, and were proceeding there, to leave that Court, shewed rather a mistrust of their own Case. But it was no objection in that Case, that it was taking it away from the Jurisdiction of the Spiritual Court. We don't come to you for any thing the Spiritual Court can grant us, for that Court goes no farther if the Fact be proved, then to make a Separation <hi>à mensâ &amp; thoro</hi> but the bonds of Marriage is to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed still; now with Submission, this is to punish the Innocent, instead of the Guilty; what would the Dutchess desire more, than to be separated from the Bed and Board of her Husband, to be left free to accompany Sr. <hi>John Germain,</hi> but we go further, for we come to the Parliament to Dissolve this Marriage, for that which is allowed by several Learned Writers, to be a Justifiable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for so doing, for Adultery committed by the Wife, 'tis Expresly that a Man shall not put away his Wife, except in Case of Fornication, this Text plainly allows, that in Case of Fornication, a Man might put away his Wife, but the Popish Canons the Doctor has named, have put a construction upon it, say they, you shall put her away, but how? She shall be removed from your Bed and Table, but you shall not Marry another. Then they say, there is no precedent of a Bill of this kind, but there hath been a previous prosecution in the Spiritual Courts; I agree the Marquess of <hi>Northampton</hi>'s Case, that that Act does recite the proceedings in the Spiritual Court, But that Case is stronger than this, for there the Marquess of <hi>Northampton</hi> had Married even in the Teeth of their Canon Law, and comes afterwards an Act of Parliament to make this Marriage good, and there the Divorce was no ingredient upon the passing of the Bill: But the Parliament Enacted the Marriage to be Lawful. In my Lord <hi>Ross</hi>'s Case, there is no mention of any Divorce.</p>
            <p>I Appeal to the Journals of your own House, for that; but notwithstanding the Divorce, the whole matter was examined over again, Witnesses were examined both in the House of Lords, and here upon the first Bill which was brought, which was to Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate, and Bastardize the Children, and the Witnesses proved, that my Lord <hi>Ross</hi> and his Lady, had not laid together for a long time, and that she had kept Company with others, so that the Parliament did not found the Bill upon what had been done upon the Divorce.</p>
            <p>I appeal to your own memory, that in the Earl of <hi>Macclesfield</hi>'s Case, there was no use at all on that side, the Bill was brought, that there had been proceedings in the Spiritual Court, nor is any such thing recited in the Bill, but only an Express down right charge of Adultery; nor was it proper for them to have mentioned any procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in the Spiritual Court, since they waved that Prosecution, but we on the other side insisted on it, as a Reason why the Parliament should not proceed in it, it being to take upon them an Original Jurisdiction, but we were then answered by a Learned Gentleman against this Bill, that it was in vain to go there, for they could not give the Remedy that might reasonably be expected. I beg the favour to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Case or two, where Divorces have been in Parliament, and there have been no Proceedings in the Spiritual Court, one of them was the Case of Mrs. <hi>Knight,</hi> who was Married <hi>infra annos Nubiles,</hi> to Mr. <hi>Goodwin.</hi> Every one knows that a Marriage, <hi>infra annos Nubiles</hi> is a good Marriage, and if the Woman be above Nine years Old, she shall be Endowed, and yet notwithstanding, for some Irregular proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with out going into the Spiritual Court, they came into Parliament, and a Bill was passed by which this Marriage was dissolved, and I think 'tis expresly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted,</p>
            <p>That she shall not Marry till such an Age. This goes farther, for here I am sure the Doctor would have complained, and told you, if there had been Reason to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:204991:30"/> dissolve the Marriage, they could have done as great a Feat in the Spiritual Court, that they could have Examined Witnesses upon Oath, and could have told you whether there was proper Evidence, yet the Parliament without any regard to what they could do, would assert their own Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>The Case of Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> was mentioned on the other side, and therefore I need not say any thing to it. There was nothing of Divorce nor needed any.</p>
            <p>They say, this Bill begins where it is proper for matters of this nature to end, and that after we have taken a turn into the Spiritual Court, and travelled Three or Four Years there, then it will be fit for the Judgment of Parliament. I would know if they had been Seven Years in that Court (and perhaps if we come there, we shall not get out sooner) to what use the Examination of that Court would be. This House I presume, would not let those Despositions be Read here, Especially if the Witnesses to these Facts were Living.</p>
            <p>They say this is a very Summary way of Proceeding, it may be to quick for the Dutchess, but you may be pleas'd to consider, that there was a Bill brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other House some years ago and rejected; upon what terms that will rest upon us, to shew you by and by.</p>
            <p>But the matter was, the Witnesses that proved the Fact, were sent out of the way by the Dutchess, and Sir <hi>John Jermain,</hi> when things were under an Examination, and we hope a matter of this Nature never shall not be baffled by keeping the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence out of the way.</p>
            <p>We told them long ago, who the Witnesses were, they were the Dutchess's Servants, such as they thought fit to intrust.</p>
            <p>They say this Bill deprives the Dutchess of her Tryal, I hope no Body thinks the Parliament will pass a Bill, without due examination of Witnesses, and Legal proof of the Fact, if so, what matter is it, whether the Proof be made before the Parliament, or some Inferiour Court, if the Dutchess be guilty of this Crime, we come here for a Relief, which the Spiritual Court, the Doctors tell you can't give us, since the Dutchess hath broke the Bond of Mattrimony, we come to you to Disolve that Marriage, and I hope we shall have it.</p>
            <p>The Doctor hath insisted on one thing that I think is very extraordinary, He tells you by the Rules of their Law, if the Woman can Reimminate, and prove her Husband guilty, in such a Case, they must set the fault of one, against the fault of the other.</p>
            <p>I wish the Doctor could have told you the offence had been Equal, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to Families had been Equal, a Man by his Folly of this kind, brings no spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Issue to Inherit the Lands of his Wife, but the Woman deprives her Husband of any ligitimate Issue, for when she converses in this Manner with another Man, the Issue may be equally lookt upon to be that Man's if not more, and this Lady hath kept this Conversation ever since the Year Sixeeen Hundred Eighty Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and left the Duke.</p>
            <p>One thing is farther Objected, and they Insist upon certain Articles of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Ninety Four, and they Read to you the Preamble of them, why Sir, the Articles if they come to be read through, I am sure it wont amount to what they pretend, it does not amount to this, that the Dutchess might use her Body as she pleased, there is no Agreement that she should live after her own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, Indeed she was to have the use of her Houshold Goods, and Servants, and Live where she pleased, but that will not justifie her in her way of Living.</p>
            <p>Then to tell you, these are matters of a long standing, they are so, and of a long continuance, for if my instructions prove true, we shall prove this Scene of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for matter of Eight Years Successively, and that by Servants that were privy to the Intregues, who were sent away to Holland, but no sooner was the Bill bafled,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:204991:31"/> but the Man was sent for again, and the same Conversation continued that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Dutchess and Sir <hi>John Germain</hi> before he left <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same was continued after he came back to his Service in (1691). only they were something more cautious, and People were not admitted so familiarly, to see them in Bed together in (1692.) and so it continued till 1695.</p>
            <p>They mentioned the Statute of Limitations, which was to put an end to frivilous and vexatious Actions; but how they can apply it to this Case, I can't see, because a Man shall not bring frivilous and vexatious Actions after a long distance of time, therefore a Man shall not complain when he hath received the greatest Injury that can be done to Mankind.</p>
            <p>Sir, They are kind to us again, in recommending it to the Duke, to go into the Spiritual Court, till next Sessions, but we think we are in a proper Method here, for that Relief which the Spiritual Court cannot grant; and since we have so good Reason to come here, if we prove the Fact, I hope this High Court will not send away a Complaint of this nature, without such Relief as is sutable.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Northey,</hi> Sir, I am of the same side, I would beg leave to say this, as to what the Council have said in relation to the Evidence, That there were three Witnesses examined upon Oath, in the House of Peers, before the Bill did pass there, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they are aware of that, and that when you hear our Witnesses, there will be no Answer to be given on their side; and indeed the Witnesses they brought, were so far from contradicting our Witnesses, that they did really confirm them. But that is not the Case now, what our Evidence is, or whether it be fit for you to believe them, that will be when you have heard them, and for the matter of the time, that you can't take notice of neither, till you hear our Evidence. But this I may say, we shall bring a Man that will speak to within four or five Years.</p>
            <p>But the matter they apply themselves to, which is material, is, Whether it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for you to proceed upon this Bill, that is, to give such a Relief as we desire by dissolving this Marriage. And in the next place, Whether this be a proper time to ask this Favour.</p>
            <p>For the first, the Learned Doctor tells you, 'tis not proper at any time to do it, for he would have the Canon-Law govern here, as it does in their Courts. But the Council on the other side, have cited you several Precedents where it hath been done. In the Case of the Marquess of <hi>Northampton,</hi> the Second Marriage was contrary to the Canon-Law, and yet that Marriage was confirmed according to God's Law. And this Bill is to relieve against the Canon-Law.</p>
            <p>Now, whether we are here in a proper time, Sir <hi>Thomas Powys</hi> has said a great many things, which may be proper to many other purposes. One Argument was, because the Witnesses can't be upon Oath, but that we know will not prevail in in this place. In the next place they except, because this Proceeding is in a Summary way. I would know of them, Whether there is not the same Objection to all Proceedings before a Jury, That they have no notice what Witnesses will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <p>Then in the next place they bring a great Argument from the Recital of some of these Bills, That there have been before a Sentence in the Ecclesiastical Courts. Now, 'tis true, they have been so in some of those Cases; but I beg leave to observe, That in the Case of the Marquess of <hi>Northampton,</hi> the Bill was not to confirm the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or to enable them to Marry, but to deliver them out of the hands of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Courts, who said it was not Lawful in that Case to Marry, for they were married before.</p>
            <p>I beg leave to say, That in the Case of my Lord <hi>Macclesfield,</hi> there was no notice in the Bill that came down to you, of any Proceedings in the Ecclesiastical Courts. And I take this to be the Reason, because there was no Sentence, though where there was a Sentence, they had good reason to take notice of it. And I think there is as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:204991:31"/> much certainty, and as good ground to proceed on this Bill, as in the other Case, for the Witnesses have been already examined in the House of Lords. In the Case of my Lord <hi>Ross,</hi> there was no regard to the Determination of the Ecclesiastical Courts, as a Guide to the Parliament; and it was looked upon as of no consequence, for the Witnesses were examined again.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, when we came before you without such a Proceeding, we came under this disadvantage, you will be sure to expect a plainer and fuller Proof, but for that we will undertake to make the Fact so plain, that they can't give the least pretence of Answer to it.</p>
            <p>We are here asking that, we can't have any where else. Their great Design is delay, and that we have learnt from the Civilian, who tells you their Methods are very grave and deliberate, and that they may have a Commission to examine Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses beyond Sea, and that is to enquire how their own Servants have lived beyond Sea.</p>
            <p>As to what Sir <hi>Thomas Powys</hi> would have, that is, that we should go into the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Court, and apply our selves again here next Sessions: I do not think the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slature will send us back to ask that in the Spiritual Court, which both have submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to; for after the Duke had miscarried in the Relief he sought by another Bill, by the Dutchess's sending the Witnesses out of the way. Why, truly, after that, to prevent any Prosecution in the Spiritual Court, the Dutchess submitted to a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Articles, and that was all the Duke could have pretended to by the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Law; we follow her upon that, and come to enforce that Separation. And to make it effectual, and for that which we humbly hope will be thought but Justice to the Duke, that is, to be delivered from this Wise, and to have liberty to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry again; we think there is no occasion for delay, and that no body can be hurt by a Precedent that carries Relief in this nature, and deliver us from a Law which in the days of Popery was put upon us. Upon the whole Matter, I hope you will think that we are here very properly for Relief, and that we shall have the favour to call our Witnesses.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Oldish,</hi> Sir, The great Objection against the passing of this Bill, was, because Witnesses had not been examined in the proper Court. 'Tis very true, generally speaking in Cases it ought to be so, but here is a very great Exception to that Rule, and which I think can't admit of an Answer, and that is the notoriety of the Fact, and in that Case they begin with Execution. And if that be so, I think there never was a clearer Demonstration in the World, for when formerly the Dutchess came to give in her Answer in the House of Lords, to the Charge against her, she did declare, That in the Year 83. or thereabouts, she went out of <hi>England,</hi> and tarried three Years, and returned about the time of the Revolution. And it does plainly appear there beyond all question, That she was at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and went under the Name of the Lady <hi>Beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and was attended by one <hi>Kemer,</hi> who went then by the Name of <hi>Goodman.</hi> Besides this, there are Witnesses that speak to particular Facts. Now, I say, here is that which amounts to Demonstration, and where there is a Notoriety of Fact, that is, an Exception out of the General Rule, and 'tis proper to begin with Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>There is an Exception to the General Councils and Canons that have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, That there shall not be a Divorce, <hi>à Vinculo.</hi> Sir, I say, it was an Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Constitution, which was against the Law of God, and tis demonstrably so, for where our Saviour says, That a Man shall not put away his Wife, except in Case of Fornication; it is plain, that in Case of Fornication he may.</p>
            <p>There is another thing insisted on; and that is, that there was a Reconciliation between the Duke and his Dutchess. 'Tis true, a Reconciliation should drown all things before that time, but when the Law takes notice in Case of a Relapse, that does <hi>recrudescere,</hi> it rubs upon the old Sore; and then that which was before laid a sleep is brought again upon the Stage, and will return with greater Vengeance. And we have plain Proof of her living in the same manner since, as before.</p>
            <p>But they would insinuate to you that in case there was a Tryal in the Ecclesiastical Court, there might be a Recrimination, but there must be a Compensation, which can't be thought in this Case; for I think in this Case, under favour, there is no Comparison. I don't think they are <hi>Paria,</hi> for 'tis impossible for the Husband to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:204991:32"/> do that Injury as the Wife may, for she may bring a Bastard into the Family, and then the Estate does not go according to the Law of God and Nature, for every body desires his own Blood should succeed him.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Tho. Powys,</hi> Sir, I shall say but very little. But Three or Four things have been mentioned on the other side; which they offer as if they conceived them to have great Weight, and yet they seem to me as very capable of being answer'd; and I crave your favour to do it.</p>
            <p>They have gone much upon the Proofs, that they are ready to make, and I think not very properly, because we speak against their proceeding upon this Bill; but I am sure it turns upon them, for according to their own shewing, they are very well prepared to proceed in a Regular Course, for they have their Witnesses ready, and nothing does obstruct them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Serg. Wright</hi> mentioned a thing, which I must confess, I was surprised in; for when I told him he could not find any Precedent of such a Bill as this, without a previous proceeding in the Spiritual Court; Mr. <hi>Serg. Wright</hi> said it was quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; and to shew you it was so, he cited Two Cases, Where there was no Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; now I always understood, a Divorce must be in any Case where there was a Marriage, for the Case of Mr. <hi>Knights,</hi> that was very lately; That was the Case of an Infant, who they pretended to have Married, <hi>infra Annos nubiles,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore says he, the declaring of that Marriage to be be Null and Void by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, was a Divorce. The other, was he Case of Mrs. <hi>Wharton,</hi> which was no Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage neither, for Marriage must be by consent, and that was a Force; and that he fancies to be a Case, where there was a Divorce too, without proceeding in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Court, and yet of his own Shewing it was no Marriage.</p>
            <p>Another thing I am much more surprised at, we insisted, that they would not shew an Act for making a Divorce, without giving the party an Opportunity to make a Defence, and the Doctor says in Common Cases it ought to be so; and they cited the Case of the Earl of <hi>Macclesfield</hi> we first mentioned, and the Doctor told you the progress it had, and that there was a full and regular proceeding, of great length of time; and that my Lady <hi>Macclesfield</hi> had all her Witnesses examined, and my Lord prosecuted her to an excommunication, which is in effect a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, for it is in our Law, as in Case of Outlawry; This he calls a Precedent where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they proceeded to get an Act of Parliament, without a previous proceeding in the Spiritual Court.</p>
            <p>He tells you in the next place, that notwithstanding the Divorce in the Case of my Lord <hi>Ross,</hi> the Parliament did examine Witnesses, 'tis true, they did, for I don't think they will so entirely pin their Faith upon those proceedings, as to have no other satisfaction. But will he therefore say they took no notice of it, when 'tis the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and ground of the Bill.</p>
            <p>He tells you in the next place, that the Crime does not seem equal between the one and the other, and so in some sort, they redicule the Doctors notion of Recri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, But I apprehend the Doctor is right in it, for it would be hard if a man should Marry a Young Woman, and give her an ill example in his own Family (I do not say 'tis this Case) and bring her acquanted with loose and ill Company, and by his example or provocation, lead her into the same Offence; would that Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be Rewarded with a new Wife, and another portion, because his first Wife, had only followed his Example.</p>
            <p>They say the Offence is not equal, because the Man brings no Children into the Family.</p>
            <p>I doubt it happens oftentimes to them that go abroad, that they bring home that to their Wives, which stick longer by them then their Children.</p>
            <p>Then to come and say, the Articles can't be of any use to us at all; and to imagine that we use the Articles, so that the Dutchess might be at perfect liberty to live in Adultery, I wonder how that Conceit hath followed him hither; when we told him we had not such a thought as to live in Adultery, but they do direct her to live separate, and so we used them, as an answer to that part; we used them likewise as an Act of Total oblivion and remission, of any thing beyond that time, and I hope to such purposes, they shall be thought Sacred.</p>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:204991:32"/>
            <p>Now, I beseech you, Sir, on the whole matter, have they on the other side, said one thing, but what does totally tend to bring all cases of Adultery immediately before you? Have they distinguished this Case from the Case of any other person? And then if they have not, I do not see from henceforward, that any but Fools will go to the Ecclesiastical Courts for relief; For, says the Serjeant, they cannot give them a final relief, and enable any person to marry again; and therefore let no body think to go there again; but here is a relief to be had worth a man's having. But I hope, we shall have the benefit of the Law, as it is, till you think fit to alter it; and then you will erect some Judicature, where people may have their trial. Now therefore the argument goes too far, or it argues nothing at all, because if there be any thing in it, it goes to take away the proceedings of those Courts totally.</p>
            <p>But though those Courts cannot do all that these Gentlemen desire, they can do what is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proper to be done. They can examine Witnesses, and pronounce Sentence; and give the party a full opportunity of knowing the Accusation and Accusers; and then the Cases we have mentioned have had the aid of an Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Sir, We have spent a great deal of your time already: I hope, since you see what use they make of the last Precedent of my Lord <hi>Macclesfield,</hi> where he did proceed to an Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Now from thence they argue, that you should proceed originally in this Case. When is the time to make a stand, but in the first Case? And then no man can complain of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury: If you grant this to my Lord, I think, in justice, you cannot deny it to any other that stands in need of it. I believe there never was the like before, and therefore, I hope, you will put a stop to it here.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dodd.</hi> The Gentlemen on the other side have told you, that our Saviour hath said, <hi>That no man should put away his Wife, except for fornication.</hi> 'Tis true, the Text is so, but he cannot shew you any Text wherein our Saviour says, That the man may marry again, though he might put his Wife away. Another thing was said, as to the proceeding in the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Courts. Dr. <hi>Oldish</hi> says, There is to be nothing but Execution, where there is a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriety of fact. And here the fact is notorious; and therefore you may come up to order Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution; but that is a strange Doctrine to our <hi>English</hi> Constitution. Would they hang one first and try him afterwards? that would make work. Let the fact be never so notorious, yet 'tis the right of all the people of <hi>England</hi> to have a legal tryal: and I hope you will not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, till there hath been a regular tryal in another place.</p>
            <p>Then Sir <hi>Thomas Powis</hi> offered to produce the Articles, but they were admitted.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>The House resolved themselves into a Committee of the whole House to consider of the Duke of</hi> Norfolk's <hi>Bill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir</hi> Rowland Gwynne <hi>took the Chair of the Committee of the whole House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Council and Sollicitors were called in, and the Bill read to them. And then Mr.</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they, <hi>of Council with the Duke, opened the Evidence thus.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Northey.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I Am of Council for the Duke of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> I shall not trouble you now (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I think it not fit) to say any thing for the Bill, for that you have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by Commitment of the Bill; and declared it to be a reasonable and just relief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Dutchess for the Adultery charged in the Bill. I shall not spend any of your time in aggravating the crime of Adultery.</p>
               <p>But that which is incumbent on his Graces Counsel now, is to lay before you the proofs of the fact suggested in the Bill. And the facts to be proved are the introduction of the Bill, That the Dutchess has lived for divers years in Separation from the Duke, and had unlawfull familiarity, and adulterous Conversation with Sir <hi>John Germain;</hi> and for that fact we will call our Witnesses.</p>
               <p>And our evidence will make this out to you, as plain as 'tis possible to expect a matter of this nature to be proved.</p>
               <p>However, I think they have managed things in that manner as we shall be able to give as plain a proof of these facts as might be expected of those acts which are in their own nature most publick. However in the nature of the thing, there were but a few persons to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with it, and those were generally Servants who had attendance on the Dutchesses per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. We shall produce you Servants both of the Dutchess, and Sir <hi>John Germain.</hi> And I hope it cannot be an Objection, That they are Servants, for to object to them, for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is to say, You shall prove the fact, but you shall have no Witnesses, for these are facts that cannot be proved but by such as were concerned with the Dutchess.</p>
               <p>For our Evidence it will fall out to be this, The Duke and Dutchess were married in the year 1677, and they lived together till about the year 1685: And then the Duke having
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:204991:33"/> some account of her conversation of this nature, they did part, and afterwards she came to live openly with Sir <hi>John Germain;</hi> for in <hi>May</hi> 1689, the Witnesses will give you an account, that for two Months together she lodged with Sir <hi>John Germain</hi> at the Cockpit. And they lived there as Man and Wife, as the Witnesses phrase it. During the time they lived there, there was a near Relation of Sir <hi>John Germain</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>Daniel Germain</hi> his Brother, and Mrs. <hi>Briana</hi> his Sister, did frequently come to the house; and two of the Witnesses were frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the room while they were a-bed together.</p>
               <p>After two Month's time, the Dutchess thought fit to be a little more private, and it was given out she was gone to <hi>France,</hi> but in truth she removed to <hi>Fox-hall</hi> to a house that was taken by Sir <hi>John Germain</hi>'s Brother, and went by the name of my Lady <hi>Beckman.</hi> And she lived there two years successively: and Sir <hi>John Germain</hi> came there frequently once or twice in a week, and lay there a-nights. During that time we have two Witnesses, that did attend the Dutchess, as well as at the Cock-pit: one of them is <hi>Ellena Vanesse,</hi> who was hired by Sir <hi>John Germain</hi>'s Sister, and lived with the Dutchess at the Cock-pit two Months. We have a second Witness, one <hi>Hosieur,</hi> who was with Sir <hi>John Germain</hi> at the Cock-pit 15 days before the Dutchess went to <hi>Fox-hall;</hi> and afterwards he went to <hi>Fox-hall,</hi> when she removed there, and stayed with her all the two years.</p>
               <p>These are both Foreigners, and <hi>Dutch</hi> people; and it was reasonable enough to expect fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Witnesses, when an <hi>English</hi> Dutchess had a foreign Gallant. They are such as he thought fit to entrust about her.</p>
               <p>After she had lived two years at <hi>Fox-hall</hi> (this brings her to the year 1691) she removed home again to her house at <hi>Milbank;</hi> and there Sir <hi>John Germain</hi> and she were frequently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and have been seen a-bed together.</p>
               <p>This brings us to the time when the Duke having an account, that she had this conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Sir <hi>John Germain,</hi> brought a Bill into the House of Peers for a Divorce; but it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, that the Dutchess, and Sir <hi>John Germain,</hi> to avoid the condemnation, kept the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses out of the way; and afterwards caused them to be sent into <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Woman stayed abroad till about 3 Months ago, but the Man returned before into Sir <hi>John Germain</hi>'s Service; and he will give you an account of what observations he made there, for the familiarity continued between them then. He was admitted into the room where they used to be; and he will give you an account, how he hath seen them frequently toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And he brings it down to within the year 1695.</p>
               <p>We have another Witness, one <hi>William Bayley,</hi> who likewise was a Servant to Sir <hi>John Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> and came into his place when <hi>Hosieur</hi> went beyond Sea. He is an unwilling Witness, because he hath been preferred by Sir <hi>John Germain;</hi> but when he was upon his Oath in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther House, he did give an account, that while he continued in Sir <hi>John Germain</hi>'s Service, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this publick reproach in 1695 and 1696, she frequently came to Sir <hi>John Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi>'s house, with one <hi>Kemer,</hi> whom she had great confidence in: and one <hi>Susanna Barring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> I think yet in the Dutchesses Service. And this Mr. <hi>Bayley</hi> will give you an account, that his Master was often from home; and when he was so, he used to carry his Linnen to this <hi>Kemer,</hi> who was the Dutchesses Servant; or this <hi>Kemer</hi> would come to him for it: and this will bring it down to 1696. There are several Witnesses to confirm this, but we think with Submission, after the Dutchess had been so accused in the House of Lords of such a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, any evidence of a Conversation between them afterwards, is as much as a thousand Witnesses, for no Woman that valued her reputation, having been accused as she was, would have had any Conversation with Sir <hi>John Germain</hi> afterwards. But we don't want circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances to support the evidence of fact. We have as plain evidence in this case, as can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in a case of this nature: we will spend no more of your time, but beg leave to call our Witnesses.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Atwood.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Sir <hi>Rowland Gwynne,</hi> please to favour me a few words on the same side; I shall not mis-spend the time of the Committee in repeating any thing said by Mr. <hi>Northey;</hi> I shall only observe, that the Witnesses, <hi>Hosieur</hi> and <hi>Vanesse</hi> say, That <hi>Susanna Barrington</hi> was privy to this adulterous Conversation. And this <hi>Susanna Barrington</hi> has withdrawn her self since the Bill was depending in the House of Lords.</p>
               <p>'Tis further proved, That Mr. <hi>Daniel Germain</hi> and Mr. <hi>Brian</hi>'s Wife were in <hi>England</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that these were privy to the same Conversation.</p>
               <p>Then the Witnesses were called in, one by one, and Interpreters allowed.</p>
               <p>The Witnesses that were examined before the Committee of the Commons were <hi>Ellena Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Nicholas Hosieur, William Bayley,</hi> and <hi>Ann Read.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all, except <hi>Ann Read,</hi> were examined in the House of Lord's, and their evidence there being at large set forth, the Reader is referred to the same. The evidence of <hi>Ann Read</hi> is as follows.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:204991:33"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ann Read</hi> being ask'd, Whether she had ever seen the Dutchess go to Sir <hi>John Germain</hi>'s house, and when, says, That about <hi>April</hi> 1692 (which was soon after the Duke's Bill had been rejected in the House of Lords) she saw the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk</hi> go in a Chair to Sir <hi>John</hi>'s house, that the door was immediately opened upon her Chair's being set down, and she went into the house with her Mask off.</p>
               <p>She being ask'd, Whether she had seen Sir <hi>John</hi> come to the Dutchesses house, and when; Says, she, within a twelve-month last past, or thereabouts, followed him to the Dutchesses house about 3 of the Clock in the Afternoon, and that she did not see him come out.</p>
               <p>After the Witnesses were examined on the part of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> for the Bill, Sir <hi>Thomas Powis</hi> of Council with the Dutchess of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> being called upon to make defence, spake to this effect.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Thomas Powys.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I am at a loss, Sir, and under some kind of a surprize, because as far as I apprehend, you call upon us to make our defence. I hope in a case of such moment as this is (and it may be there cannot be greater) and since you are pleased to take this case out of the usual way of tryals, and to try it in the first instance, you will be pleased, that we should be fairly and regularly heard. And since it was not allowed us upon our being heard against the Bill, that we should have a time to make our defence. Now we have heard what the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses swear, we shall desire but a short time, no more than what is absolutely necessary to make our defence. This hath spent us 6 hours already; and I am sure the Witnesses that have been examined, have given such variety of Answers, that it doth afford a great deal to be said to it. We have likewise a good many Witnesses to be examined; but I am far from proposing any thing to delay it. We had a weeks time allowed us in the House of Lords, but that is no rule for you, and we don't expect it here. But even while we are at this Barr, a person from a very worthy Member gives us intelligence, upon sight of this Cook-maid, of a matter that will defame her; and he will be ready to make it out, that she was turned away for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a common Thief in <hi>Holland:</hi> and therefore, Sir, you see how time is necessary in point of Accidents that do happen; and I cannot make our defence now.</p>
               <p>Thereupon the Council withdrew; and the Committee having considered of the desire of the Council for the Dutchess to have time allowed them to make their defence, were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That the Council should proceed then to make their defence; and Candles were orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be brought in.</p>
               <p>And the Council being called in again, Sir <hi>Rowland Gwynne</hi> being in the Chair of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, acquainted them with the determination of the Committee.</p>
               <p>Then Sir <hi>Thomas Powys</hi> observed upon the Evidence that had been given; and insisted, that the Evidence given before the Committee of Commons, did differ from the evidence given by them upon Oath in the House of Lords; and offer'd to produce the Examination of the said Witnesses upon Oath in the House of Lords. And an Objection being made, that such Examination ought not to be read in that case, as Evidence before this Committee; the Council withdrew, and the Committee considered of the said Objection, and were of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the said depositions should not be read.</p>
               <p>And Council being called in again, were acquainted with it, and that if they had any Witnesses, <hi>viva voce,</hi> to encounter their evidence, they might produce them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Thomas Powys.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Sir, By this Resolution, my Client is deprived of that defence I thought I could have made for her, but I submit to the pleasure of the Committee.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Atwood.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>The Examinations in the House of Lords were so lately, that 'tis an easie thing for the Sollicitors, who were by, to give an account of a contrariety in the evidence, if there were any.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A Member.</speaker>
               <p>Whether you have any other evidence to offer, but as to this point?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Tho. Powys.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>All our evidence would tend to contradict these Witnesses; and if the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those Depositions won't be allowed, we must abide your pleasure, and submit it to you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Dodd.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>We submit it to you; our Witnesses were in concurrence with that sort of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Rowland Gwynne.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>There are several persons named, who are persons of Credit and good Reputation, Mr. <hi>Brian</hi> and his Lady, Mr. <hi>Daniel Germain</hi> and his Sister; these would be Witnesses of Credit, against those that are you say not of Credit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Council.</hi> We have summoned them, and Mrs. <hi>Pitt,</hi> and done all that we could on our side to get them here. And I hope you won't prejudge our case, to say they are in our interest; that is to determine the question. We have likewise summoned Mrs. <hi>Pitt</hi> and her two maids, and whether they will appear or not, that we cannot tell, but this we are ready to make out to you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Atwood.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Susanna Barrington</hi> the Dutchesses Woman, privy to the whole conversation, is proved to have been with her since the Bill was brought into the House of Lords.</p>

               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:204991:34"/>
               <speaker>A Member.</speaker>
               <p>Whether he has one living Witness to produce, that he can make good his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence by?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Tho. Powys.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Sir, if you expect an answer from me, I am assured, that we have Witnesses, but if I cannot bring those people against themselves; if I cannot bring <hi>Nichola</hi> against <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> I despair of doing any good, if I bring a 1000 other Witnesses against him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I pray this favour of you; That since 'tis your pleasure, that this evidence be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, you will not make a bad construction of it, that I do not proceed to make a defence to this Bill, for I cannot truly do it, unless I had some other Instructions from my Client, but shall defeat her expectation to proceed upon the other part of the case, since what we built upon with good Authority, as we thought, is not thought fit to be admitted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Rowland Gwynne.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Sir, you are at liberty to go on, if you have any thing more to say, than that you cannot proceed without further directions from your Client.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A Member.</speaker>
               <p>Whether they have any thing to offer in the defence of the Dutchess upon the crime she is charged with; for I believe 'tis a new thing for the Council, when their Client is charged with a crime, to say, they cannot defend her, unless they go, and ask, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they shall defend her or no? If they have any thing to say in her defence, we shall be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to hear it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Rowland Gwynne.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Powys,</hi> have you any thing more to say?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Tho. Powys.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>I cannot but repeat what I have already said, That I would be glad to make the best defence this case may bear: and I may say, I have defended it twice with very good success, and this is a third time: and I would make the best defence this case would bear now. And I must own to you, that the course of our evidence, we did propose to our selves is so far broke, by the first determination you were pleased to make, that I cannot ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the rest of the defence, if so be your pleasure be not to admit of this matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Rowland Gwynne.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>You may by any Sollicitors or Agents, that were present when these Witnesses were examined in the House of Lords, prove what they swore there.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Dodd.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>We apprehend you have already determined the matter, and we cannot now meddle with it; but if I apprehend it a-right from the Chair, it is your Opinion, that we may produce the Sollicitors and Agents to give an account of what was sworn in the House of Lords. Now we are under this disability by your determination, That we relying upon what you have determined against us, are not prepared with our Sollicitors or others to give evidence of that matter; but in a little time they will be able to give you an account of what was then sworn.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Atwood.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>It seems they want to be taught their Lesson.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>And then the Council withdrew, and the Committee proceeded upon the Bill, Clause by Clause, and went through it, and ordered the same to be reported.</p>
